<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>This book is Vol. ii. The first volume can be found in Project Gutenberg at<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/55968">
http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/55968</a></p>

<p>This volume covers the period from 1713 to 1763. The Julian calendar
was still in use in England for much of this time. The change to the
Gregorian calendar took place in Europe beginning in 1582, but in
Britain not until 1752, producing a difference of eleven days between
the Julian Old Style (OS) and the modern Gregorian New Style (NS)
dates. Many Sidenotes and some Footnotes for the years before 1753 give both dates since
contemporary English reference documents of that period used the OS date.</p>

<p>The OS/NS dates are shown for example as
<span class="fs90">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">Sept. 20</span>
  <span class="blka over">Oct. 1.</span>
</span> or
Mar. <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">2</span>
  <span class="blka over">13</span>
</span>
</span>.</p>

<p>Footnote anchors are denoted by <span class="fnanchor">[number]</span>, and the <a href="#FOOTNOTES">footnotes</a>
themselves have been placed near the end of the book in front of the Index.</p>

<p>The <a href="#INDEX">Index</a> in this book covers both volumes. References in the Index
to Vol. i or Vol. ii pages are indicated for example by "i. 123, 456" or "ii. 234". <span class="screenonly">The link
will go to the correct page in that volume.</span><span class="handonly">The links to vol i are not active on handheld devices.</span></p>

<p>Some minor changes to this volume are noted at the <a href="#TN">end of the book.</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1713.<br />1714.</div>

<p class="noindent">The work of disbanding the Army began some months
before the final conclusion of the Peace of Utrecht.
By Christmas 1712 thirteen regiments of dragoons,
twenty-two of foot, and several companies of invalids
who had been called up to do duty owing to the
depletion of the regular garrisons, had been actually
broken. The Treaty was no sooner signed than several
more were disbanded, making thirty-three thousand
men discharged in all. More could not be reduced
until the eight thousand men who were left in garrison
in Flanders could be withdrawn, but even so the total
force on the British Establishment, including all colonial
garrisons, had sunk in 1714 to less than thirty thousand
men. The soldiers received as usual a small bounty
on discharge; and great inducements were offered to
persuade them to take service in the colonies, or, in
other words, to go into perpetual exile.</p>

<p>But this disbandment was by no means so commonplace
and artless an affair as might at first sight appear.
One of the first measures taken in hand by Bolingbroke
and by his creature Ormonde was the remodelling of
the Army, by which term was signified the elimination
of officers and of whole corps that favoured the
Protestant succession, to make way for those attached
to the Jacobite interest. Prompted by such motives,
and wholly careless of the feelings of the troops, they
violated the old rule that the youngest regiments should
always be the first to be disbanded, and laid violent
hands on several veteran corps. The Seventh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Eighth Dragoons, the Thirty-fourth, Thirty-third,
Thirty-second, Thirtieth, Twenty-ninth, Twenty-eighth,
Twenty-second, and Fourteenth Foot were ruthlessly
sacrificed; nay, even the Sixth, one of the sacred six
old regiments, and distinguished above all others in the
Spanish War, was handed over for dissolution like a
regiment of yesterday.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There were bitter words and
stormy scenes among regimental officers over such
shameless, unjust, and insulting procedure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">

</span>.
</div>

<p>All these designs, however, were suddenly shattered
by the death of Queen Anne. The accession of the
Elector of Hanover to the throne was accomplished
with a tranquillity which must have amazed even those
who desired it most. Before the new King could
arrive the country was gladdened by the return of
the greatest of living Englishmen. Landing at Dover
on the very day of the Queen's death, Marlborough
was received with salutes of artillery and shouts of
delight from a joyful crowd. Proceeding towards
London next day he was met by the news that his
name was excluded from the list of Lords-Justices to
whom the government of the country was committed
pending the King's arrival. Deeply chagrined, but
preserving always his invincible serenity, he pushed on
to the capital, intending to enter it with the same
privacy that he had courted during his banishment in
the Low Countries. But the people had decided that
his entry must be one of triumph; and a tumultuous
welcome from all classes showed that the country could
and would make amends for the shameful treatment
meted out to him two years before.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September King George landed at
Greenwich, and shortly afterwards the new ministry was
nominated. Stanhope, the brilliant soldier of the Peninsular
War, became second Secretary-of-State; William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Pulteney, afterwards Earl of Bath, Secretary-at-War;
Robert Walpole, Paymaster of the Forces; while
Marlborough with some reluctance resumed his old
appointments of Captain-General, Master-General of
the Ordnance, and Colonel of the First Guards. He
soon found, however, that though he held the titles,
he did not hold the authority of the offices, and that
the true control of the Army was transferred to the
Secretary-at-War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715.<br />May 24.</div>

<p>How weak that Army had become was presently
realised at the outbreak of the Jacobite rebellion in the
autumn of 1715. The estimates of 1714 had provided
for a British establishment of twenty-two thousand men,
of which two-thirds were stationed in Flanders and
in colonial garrisons, leaving a dangerously small force
for the defence of the kingdom. Even this poor
remnant the Jacobite Lords had tried to weaken, by
introducing a clause in the Mutiny Act to confine all
regiments to the particular districts allotted to them
in the British Isles. This insidious move, which was
designed to prevent the transfer of troops between
Ireland and England, was checked by the authority of
Marlborough himself. The King, it seems, had early
perceived the perils of such a situation; and accordingly,
in January, the Seventh Dragoons were recreated and
restored under their old officers, together with four
more of the old regiments.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In July the prospect of
a rising in Scotland made further increase imperative,
and orders were issued for the raising of thirteen
regiments of dragoons and eight of foot, some few
of which must for a brief moment detain us.</p>

<p>The first of the new regiments of dragoons was
Pepper's, the present Eighth Hussars, which for a
time had shared the hard fate of the Seventh, and was
now, like the Seventh, restored to life. The next six,
Wynn's, Gore's, Honeywood's, Bowles's, Munden's, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Dormer's, are now known respectively as the Ninth
Lancers, the Tenth and Eleventh Hussars, the Twelfth
Lancers, and the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Hussars,
regiments which have made their mark on many a field
in the Peninsula and in India, while two of them bear
on their appointments the name of Balaclava. The
remaining six were disbanded in 1718.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Of the foot
six regiments also perished after a short life in 1718;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the remaining two were old regiments, the Twenty-second
and the Thirty-fourth, each of which was
destined in due time to add to its colours the name of
a victory peculiar to itself.</p>

<p>It may be asked whether no use was made of the
hundreds of veterans who had returned from the wars
of Flanders. The answer gives us a curious insight
into the old conception of a reserve. On the first alarm
of a rising, the whole of the officers on half-pay were
called upon to hold themselves ready for service;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and
concurrently twenty-five companies of Chelsea pensioners
were formed to take over the duties of the garrisons
and to release the regular troops for work in the field.
For many years after as well as before this date the
same system is found in force; and of this, as of so
many obsolete institutions, there is fortunately a living
relic still with us. In March 1719 ten of these
veteran companies were incorporated into a regiment
under Colonel Fielding, and having begun life with the
name of Fielding's Invalids, survive to this day as the
Forty-first Foot.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>I shall not detain the reader with any detailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>account of the abortive insurrection of 1715. The
operations entailed by an invasion of England from
the north are always the same. The occupation of
Stirling cuts off the Highlands from the Lowlands,
and bars any advance from the extreme north. An
invasion from the Lowlands may be checked on either
flank of the Cheviots, on the east coast at the lines
of the Tweed or the Tyne, or, if headed back from
thence, on the west coast at the line of the Ribble. If
both Highlands and Lowlands are in revolt, there is
the third resource of a simultaneous attack from north
and south upon Stirling. This last course lay open to
the insurgents on this occasion but was not accepted.
The two decisive engagements were accordingly fought,
one at Sheriffmuir, a little to the north of Stirling, the
other at Preston, whither the insurgents of the Lowlands,
checked by an insignificant force on the east
coast, made a hopeless and futile march to the west,
and were enveloped by English forces marching simultaneously
from east, west, and south. None the less
the peril to England was great. The force at Stirling
was far too weak for the duty assigned to it; and
Sheriffmuir was one of those doubtful actions from
which each army emerges with one wing defeated and
the other victorious. The English force on the Tweed
was made up of raw recruits, and was so weak in
numbers that General Carpenter, a veteran of Flanders
and Spain, who commanded it, accomplished his work
chiefly by the bold face with which he met a dangerous
position. Such was the military impotence of England
after a bare two years of peace.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1716.<br />1717.</div>

<p>The panic caused by the insurrection swelled the
military estimates of 1716 very considerably. Apart
from the new regiments raised for the occasion, the
strength of every existing troop and company had been
augmented, while the addition of a battalion to each
regiment of Guards increased the brigade to the total
of seven battalions, which constituted its strength
unaltered almost for the next two centuries. The full
establishment voted by Parliament for Great Britain
was thirty-six thousand men, exclusive of course of
troops in Ireland, and of six thousand Dutchmen, who
had been sent over by the States-General in fulfilment
of obligations by treaty. The very next year, however,
saw the establishment diminished by one-fourth, and
in May the King announced that he had given orders
to reduce the army by ten thousand men more. The
estimates for 1718 accordingly provided for but
sixteen thousand men in Great Britain, while those for
1719 diminished even that handful by one-fourth, and
brought the total down to the figure of twelve thousand
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1718.<br />1719.</div>

<p>Then as usual the numbers were found to be
dangerously weak. A quarrel between Spain and the
Empire, and the ambitious designs of Cardinal Alberoni
brought about a breach between England and Spain,
which finally culminated in the attack and defeat of
the Spanish fleet by Admiral Byng off Cape Passaro.
The action was fought before war had actually been
declared, and Byng affected to treat it as an unfortunate
accident; but Alberoni was too much incensed at the
subversion of his designs to heed such empty blandishment
as this. He prepared to avenge himself by
making terms with the Jacobites and by fitting out
an expedition from Cadiz for the support of the
Pretender. The force was to be commanded by
Ormonde, the same poor, misguided man who had
supplanted Marlborough in Flanders; but the menace
was formidable none the less. At the meeting of
Parliament the King gave warning that an invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
must be looked for, and received powers to augment
the Army to meet it. Nevertheless, it was thought
best once more to borrow six thousand foreigners from
the Dutch and Austrian Netherlands; and England's
contribution to her own defence consisted in no more
than the transfer of four weak battalions from the Irish
to the British establishment. The King's ministers
took credit, when the danger was over, for the moderation
with which they had exercised the powers entrusted
to them, failing to see that resort to mercenary troops
at such a time was a policy wanting as much in true
statesmanship as in honour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 16.<br />June 10.</div>

<p>For the rest the peril vanished, as four generations
earlier had the peril of a still greater Spanish invasion,
before wind and tempest. The Spanish transports were
dispersed by a gale in the Bay of Biscay, and the great
armament crept back by single ships to Cadiz, crippled,
shattered, barely saved by the sacrifice of guns, horses
and stores from the fury of the storm. Two frigates
only reached the British coast and landed three Scottish
peers&mdash;Lords Tullibardine, Marischal and Seaforth&mdash;with
three hundred Spanish soldiers, at Kintail in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Ros-shire'">Ross-shire</ins>.
Here the little party remained unmolested for
several weeks, being joined by some few hundred restless
Highland spirits, but supported by no general rising
of the clans. At length, however, General Carpenter
detached General Wightman with a thousand men from
Inverness, who fell upon the insurgents in the valley
of Glenshiel and, though their force was double that
of his own, dispersed them utterly.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The campaign
ended, like all mountain-campaigns, in the burning
of the houses and villages of the offending clans;
and thus ignominiously ended this hopeless and futile
insurrection. Its most remarkable result was that
it drove Lord Marischal and his brother into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Prussian service, and gave to Frederick the Great
one of his best officers and most faithful friends&mdash;that
James Keith who fell forty years later on the field of
Hochkirch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 21.</div>

<p>Such aggression, failure though it was, naturally
led the English to make reprisals; and in September
a British squadron sailed from Spithead with four
thousand troops on board for a descent on the Spanish
coast. The original object of the expedition had been
an attack on Corunna, but Lord Cobham,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> who was in
command, thought the enterprise too hazardous, and
turned his arms against Vigo. The town being weakly
held was at once surrendered, and the citadel capitulated
after a few days of siege. A considerable quantity of
arms and stores, which had been prepared for Ormonde's
expedition, was captured, and with this small advantage
to his credit, Cobham re-embarked his troops for
England.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Shortly afterwards Alberoni opened negotiations
for peace, which he purchased at the cost of his
own dismissal. The treaty was signed on the 19th of
January 1720, and England entered upon twenty years
of unbroken peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1722.</div>

<p>But before I touch upon the history of that peace
I may be allowed to advance two years to record an
event which may fittingly close the first thirty years
of conflict with Jacobitism and its allies. On the 16th
of June 1722 died John, Duke of Marlborough.
Constantly during his later campaigns he had suffered
from giddiness and headache, and in May 1716 the
shock caused by the death of his daughter, Lady
Sunderland, brought on him a paralytic stroke. He
rallied, but was struck down a second time in November
of the same year; and although, contrary to the
received opinion, he again rallied, preserving his speech,
his memory, and his understanding little impaired, yet it
was evident that his life's work was done. In the few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>years that remained to him he still attended the House
of Lords, spending the session of 1721 as usual in
London, and retiring at its close to Windsor Lodge.
There at the beginning of June in the following year
he was smitten for the third time, and after lingering
several days, helpless but conscious, he at dawn of the
16th passed peacefully away.</p>

<p>On the 14th of July the body was brought to
Marlborough House. In those days London was
empty at that season, and only in Hyde Park, where
the whole of the household troops were encamped, was
there sign of unusual activity. Day after day the Foot
Guards were drilled in a new exercise to be used at
the funeral; the weeks wore on, the day of Blenheim
came and went, and at length on the 9th of August
all was ready. From Marlborough House along the
Mall and Constitution Hill to Hyde Park Corner,
from thence along Piccadilly and St. James's Street to
Charing Cross and the Abbey, the way was lined with
the scarlet coats of the Guards. The drums were
draped in black, the colours wreathed with cypress;
every officer wore a black scarf, and every soldier a
bunch of cypress in his bosom. Far away from down
the river sounded minute after minute the dull boom
of the guns at the Tower.</p>

<p>The procession opened with the advance of military
bands, followed by a detachment of artillery. Then
came Lord Cadogan, the devoted Quartermaster-General
who had prepared for the Duke so many of his fields,
and with him eight General Officers, veterans who had
fought under their great Chief on the Danube and in
Flanders. Among these was Munden, the hero who
had led the forlorn hope at Marlborough's first great
action of the Schellenberg, and had brought back with
him but twenty out of eighty men. Then followed
a vast cavalcade of heralds, officers-at-arms and
mourners, with all the circumstance and ceremony of
an age when pomp was lavished on the least illustrious
of the dead; and in the midst, encircled by a forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of banners, rolled an open car, bearing the coffin.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Upon the coffin lay a complete suit of gilt armour,
above it was a gorgeous canopy, around it military
trophies, heraldic devices, symbolic presentations of
the victories that the dead man had won and of the
towns which he had captured, strange contrast to the
still white face, serene beyond even the invincible
serenity of life, that slept within.</p>

<p>As the car passed by there rang out to company
after company of the silent Guards a new word of
command. "Reverse your arms." "Rest on your
arms reversed." The officers lowered their pikes, the
ensigns struck their colours, and every soldier turned
the muzzle of his musket to the ground and bent his
head over the butt "in a melancholy posture." The
procession moved slowly on, and the troops, still with
arms reversed, formed up in its rear and marched with
it. Fifty-two years before, John Churchill, the unknown
ensign of the First Guards, had marched in procession
behind the coffin of George Monk, Duke of Albemarle;
now he too was faring on to share Monk's resting-place.</p>

<p>At the Horse Guards the Guards wheeled into St.
James's Park and formed up on the parade-ground,
where the artillery with twenty guns was already formed
up before them. The car crept on to the western door
of the Abbey, and then rose up for the first time that
music which will ever be heard so long as England
shall bury her heroes with the rites of her national
Church. Within the Abbey the gray old walls were
draped with black, and nave and choir and transept
were ablaze with tapers and flambeaux. Of England's
greatest all were there, the living and the dead. The
helmet of Harry the Fifth, still dinted with the blows
of Agincourt, hung dim above his tomb, looking down
on the stolid German who now sat upon King Harry's
throne, and on his heir the Prince of Wales, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
won his spurs at Oudenarde. And at the organ, humble
and unnoticed, sat William Croft, little dreaming that he
too had done immortal work, but content to listen to
the beautiful music which he had made, and to wait
till the last sound of the voices should have died away.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Then the organ spoke under his hand in such sweet
tones as are heard only from the organs of that old
time, and the procession moved through nave and
choir to King Henry the Seventh's chapel. By a
strange irony the resting-place chosen for the great
Duke was the vault of the family of Ormonde, but it
was not unworthy, for it had held the bones of Oliver
Cromwell.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Then the voice of Bishop Atterbury, Dean
of Westminster, rose calm and clear with the words of
the service; and the anthem sang sadly, "Cry ye fir-trees,
for the cedar is fallen." The gorgeous coffin
sank glittering into the shadow of the grave, and Garter
King-at-Arms, advancing, proclaimed aloud, "Thus
has it pleased Almighty God to take out of this
transitory world unto his mercy the most high, mighty
and noble prince, John, Duke of Marlborough." Then
snapping his wand he flung the fragments into the vault.</p>

<p>As he spoke three rockets soared aloft from the
eastern roof of the Abbey. A faint sound of distant
drums broke the still hush within the walls, and then
came a roar which shook the sable hangings and made
the flame of the torches tremble again, as the guns on
the parade-ground thundered out their salvo of salute.
Thrice the salvo was repeated; the drums sounded
faintly and ceased, and all again was still. And then
burst out a ringing crash of musketry as the Guards,
two thousand strong, discharged their answering volley.
Again the volley rang out, and yet again; and then the
drums sounded for the last time, and the great Duke
was left to his rest.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>From such a scene I must turn to the further work
that lies before me in the events of the next twenty
years; and it will be convenient to deal first with the
political aspect of the Army's history. England, it
must be observed, had not yet recovered from the indiscipline
and unrest of the Great Rebellion. Since the death
of Elizabeth the country, except during the short years
of the Protectorate, had not known a master. William
of Orange, who had at any rate the capacity to rule it,
was unwilling to give himself the trouble; Marlborough,
while his power lasted, had been occupied chiefly with
the business of war; and during the reign of both war
had been a sufficient danger in the one case and a sufficient
cause of exultation in the other to distract undisciplined
minds. Now, however, there was peace. A
foreign prince had ascended the throne, a worthy person
and very far from an incapable man, but uninteresting,
ignorant of England, and unable to speak a word of her
language. The tie of nationality and the reaction of
sentiment which had favoured the restoration of Charles
the Second were wanting. The country too, after prolonged
occupation with the business of pulling down
one king and setting up another, had imbibed a dangerous
contempt of all authority whatsoever.</p>

<p>Other influences contributed not less forcibly to
increase the prevalent indiscipline. Many old institutions
were rapidly falling obsolete. The system of
police was hopelessly inefficient, and the press had not
yet concentrated the force of public opinion into an ally
of law and order. In all classes the same lawlessness
was to be found; showing itself among the higher by a
fashionable indifference to all that had once been
honoured as virtue, an equally fashionable indulgence
towards debauchery, and an irresistible tendency to
decide every dispute by immediate and indiscriminate
force. Among the lower classes, despite the most sanguinary
penal code in Europe, brutal crime, not of
violence only, was dangerously rife. No man who was
worth robbing could consider himself safe in London,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
whether in the streets or in his own house. Patrols of
Horse and Foot Guards failed to ensure the security of
the road between Piccadilly and Kensington;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and
further afield the footpad and the highwayman reigned
almost undisturbed. Nor did great criminals fail to
awake lively sympathy among the populace. The names
of Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard enjoy some halo of
heroism to this day; and frequently, when some
desperate malefactor was at last brought to Tyburn, it
was necessary to escort him to execution and, supposing
that the gallows had not been cut down by sympathisers
during the night, to surround him with soldiers lest he
should be rescued by the mob. All over England the
case was the same. Strikes, riots, smuggling, incendiarism
and general lawlessness flourished with alarming
vigour, rising finally to such a height that, by the
confession of a Secretary-of-State in the House of
Commons, it was unsafe for magistrates to do their duty
without the help of a military force.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Against this mass of disorder the only orderly force
that could be opposed was the Army. It will presently
be seen that the Army had grave enough faults of its
own, but the outcry against it was levelled not at its
faults but at its power as a disciplined body to execute
the law. So far, therefore, the unpopularity of the
Army was fairly universal. But its most formidable
opponents were bred by faction, the Jacobites who
wished to re-establish the Stuarts naturally objecting to
so dangerous an obstacle to their designs. The howl
against the Army was raised in the House of Commons
as early as in 1714, and in 1717 a Jacobite member
who, being more conspicuous for honesty than for
wisdom, was known as "Downright Shippen," opened a
series of annual motions for the reduction of the forces.
This self-imposed duty, as he once boasted to the
House, he fulfilled on twenty-one successive occasions,
though on thirteen of them he had found no seconder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>to support him.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> If this had been all, no great harm
could have resulted; but the watchword of a baffled
opposition, artfully stolen from old times of discontent,
was too useful not to be generally employed, and "No
Standing Army" became the parrot's cry of every
political adventurer, every discontented spirit, every
puny aspirant to importance. Walpole himself did not
disdain to avail himself of it during the four years
which he spent out of office between 1717 and 1721,
and the stock arguments of the malcontents were never
urged more ably nor more mischievously than by
Marlborough's Secretary-at-War.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The Lords again
were little behind the Commons, and Jacobite peers
who had commanded noble regiments in action were
not ashamed to drag the name of their profession
through the dirt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714-1739.</div>

<p>In such circumstances, where the slightest false
step might have imperilled the very existence of the
Army, the administration of the forces and the recommendation
of their cost to the House of Commons
became matters of extreme delicacy. It has already
been told how the King, as the alarm of the first
Jacobite rebellion subsided, voluntarily reduced the
Army by ten thousand men at a stroke. Such policy,
dangerous though it was from a military standpoint,
was undoubtedly wise; it was the sacrifice of half the
cargo to save the ship, an ingenious transformation of a
necessity into a virtue. Even before the Spanish War
was ended but fourteen thousand men were asked for
as the British establishment, the remainder of the Army
being hidden away in Ireland; and the same number
was presented on the estimates up to the year 1722.
In the autumn of that year, however, the administration
insisted that the number should be raised to eighteen
thousand. The spirits of the Jacobites had been raised
by the birth of Prince Charles Edward; there had been
general uneasiness in the country; troops had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>encamped ready for service all the summer, and
six regiments had been brought over from Ireland.
The augmentation was bitterly opposed in
Parliament, but was carried in the Commons by a
large majority, and was judiciously executed, not by
the formation of new regiments but by raising the
strength of existing corps to a respectable figure.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Until this increase was made, said Lord Townsend
in the House of Lords in the following year, it
was impossible to collect four thousand men without
leaving the King, the capital, and the fortified places
defenceless.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Having secured his eighteen thousand men, Walpole
resolved that in future this number should form the
regular strength for the British Establishment. In 1727
the menace of a war with Spain brought about the
addition of eight thousand men, but in 1730 the former
establishment was resumed and regularly voted year
after year until the outbreak of the Spanish War in
1739. Year after year, of course, the same factious
motives for reduction were put forward and the same
futile arguments repeated for the hundredth time.
"Slavery under the guise of an army for protection of
our liberties" was one favourite phrase, while the valour
of the untrained Briton was the theme of many an
orator. Men who, like Sir William Yonge and William
Pulteney, had held the office of Secretary-at-War, were,
when in opposition, as loud as the loudest and as foolish
as the most foolish in such displays. "I hope, sir,"
said the former in 1732, "that we have men enough in
Great Britain who have resolution enough to defend
themselves against any invasion whatever, though there
were not so much as one red-coat in the whole
kingdom." On the side of the Government the counter
arguments were drawn from an excellent source, namely,
from the disastrous results of wholesale disbandment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>after the Peace of Ryswick. The establishment was, in
fact, far too small. It would have been impossible (to
use Walpole's own words) even after several weeks'
time to mass five thousand men at any one point to
meet invasion, without stripping the capital of its
defences and leaving it at the mercy of open and secret
enemies.</p>

<p>Foiled in its attempts to reduce the numbers of the
Army, the Opposition sought to weaken it by interference
with its administration and discipline, for which
mischief the discussion of the Mutiny Act gave annual
opportunity. Here again it was Walpole who set
the evil example. He it was who maintained that
the Irish Establishment must be counted as part of
the standing Army, who insinuated that the British
regiments, with their enormous preponderance of officers
as compared with men, were potentially far stronger
than they seemed to be, who encouraged the Commons
to dictate to the military authorities the proportion
that should be observed between horse, foot, and
dragoons.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He too it was who imperilled the passing
of the Mutiny Act by advancing the old commonplace
that a court-martial in time of peace was unknown
to English law, and that mutiny and desertion should
be punished by the civil magistrate. He it was once
more who blamed the ministry for sending the fleet to
the Mediterranean instead of keeping it at home to
guard the coast, and gave his authority to the false
idea that the function of a British fleet in war is to
lie at anchor in British ports. Such were the aberrations
of a conscience which fell blind directly it moved
outside the circle of office.</p>

<p>The Opposition was not slow to take advantage of
such powerful advocacy, but fortunately with no very
evil results. An address to the King was carried,
praying that all vacancies, except in the regiments of
Guards, should be filled up by appointment of officers
on the list of half-pay. The King willingly acceded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for indeed he had already anticipated the request; and
this rule was conscientiously adhered to, both by him
and by his successor. It made for economy, no doubt,
but it also weakened what then counted as the most
efficient form of military reserve; and the result was
that officers were forbidden to resign their commissions,
being allowed to retire on half-pay only, so that their
services might still be at command.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The Articles of
War were also sent down to the Commons, and may
still be read in their journals.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It must suffice here to
say that they made careful provision for the trial of
all but strictly military crimes by the civil power.
Here, however, was a new precedent for allowing
Parliament a voice not only in the broad principles, but
in the details of discipline.</p>

<p>The Opposition in both Houses did not at once
take advantage of this innovation, but confined itself
to discourses on the inutility and danger of a Mutiny
Act at large. It was not surprising that the ignominious
Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, should have declaimed
against the Act, but it was a sad revelation of factious
feeling to find an old colonel, Lord Strafford, declaring
that the country got on very well without it in King
William's time. Nor must it be thought that, because
the Act was ultimately passed every year, no inconvenience
resulted from the obstruction in Parliament.
On at least one occasion it was not renewed in sufficient
time. The courts-martial held after its expiration
were therefore invalid, and as prisoners could not be
tried twice for the same offence, a number of them
escaped scot-free.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> It was not until 1726 that the
attacks upon the measure began to subside, and even
then the Government was afraid to introduce necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>amendments, lest by calling attention to the Act it
should blow the dull embers of hostility anew into
flame.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The next attempted encroachment of Parliament
was of a more dangerous nature, though it was more
than a little excused by extreme provocation. In the
heat of resentment against the opposition to his favourite
scheme of an Excise Bill, Walpole in 1733 persuaded
the King not only to dismiss his opponents from their
places about the court, but to deprive the Duke of
Bolton and Lord Cobham, Colonels of the King's
Dragoon Guards and of the Blues, and Cornet William
Pitt of the King's Dragoon Guards<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of their commissions.
This was to inflict the severest of military
punishments short of death for a political disobligation,
and was justly seized upon by the Opposition as a
monstrous abuse. Lord Morpeth accordingly brought
forward a motion in the Commons to make officers
of the rank of lieutenant-colonel or above it irremovable
except by sentence of court-martial or upon address of
either House. The issue thus raised was direct, since
by the Articles of War no officer could be dismissed
except by Royal Order or sentence of a general court-martial.
The debate was very ingenious on both sides,
but the motion was lost without a division. The most
remarkable speech was that of General Wade, who
opposed Lord Morpeth on the ground that he had
the greatest difficulty in collecting officers for a court-martial,
and that they would be still more negligent if
they could be dismissed only by sentence of their
fellows. "In short, sir," he said, in words of significant
warning, "the discipline of our army is already in a
very bad way, and, in effect, this alteration will only
make it worse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The study of the mingling of political and military
influence on the Army will enlighten us as to the
cause of this indiscipline. In the first place, it will be
noticed that there was no Commander-in-Chief. Lord
Cadogan had succeeded Marlborough as captain-general,
but even Marlborough had been powerless since his
restoration, and he was not in the modern sense of the
word a commander-in-chief. The result was that the
whole of the authority attached to the office fell into
the hands of the Secretary-at-War. That functionary
still received as heretofore a military commission, and
was nominally a mere secretary, not a minister nor
secretary-of-state; and early in the reign he took the
opportunity in the person of William Pulteney to
repudiate anything approaching to a minister's responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
So far as any one was answerable for the Army,
it was that secretary-of-state whose duties were later
apportioned to the Home Office; and hence we find
the Secretary-at-War, though really in control of the
whole Army, sending daily requests to the Secretary-of-State
for the preparation of commissions,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> since he
himself in theory could sign documents not as the
King's adviser, but only as his clerk. As a mere
matter of routine this arrangement was most inconvenient,
but this would have signified little had it not
also been dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Peculiar circumstances, now long obsolete, gave this
irresponsible secretary peculiar powers. In the first
place, it must be remembered that as yet barracks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>almost unknown. There were, it is true, barracks at
the Tower, at the Savoy, at Hull, and at Edinburgh,
wherein there was accommodation for the half or even
the whole of a battalion; and there was also a barrack
at every garrisoned town capable of holding at least the
handful of men who were supposed to keep the guns in
order. But for the most part the Army was scattered
all over the country in minute detachments,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> for inns
were the only quarters permitted by the Mutiny Act,
and the number of those inns was necessarily limited.
In Ireland the paucity of ale-houses had led comparatively
early to the construction of barracks, with great
comfort alike to the soldiers and to the population, but
in England the very name of barrack was anathema.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
It was in vain that military men pointed to the sister
island and urged that Great Britain too might have
barracks. The Government was afraid to ask for them,
and the opposition combated any hint of such an innovation,
"that the people might be sensible of the
fetters forged for them."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The apportionment of quarters fell within the province
of the Secretary-at-War; and it is obvious that
whether the presence of soldiery were an advantage to
a town or the reverse, the power to inflict it could usefully
be turned to political ends. A frequent accusation
was that troops were employed to intimidate the voters
at elections; and indeed the newspapers, not very trustworthy
on such points, assert that at the election at
Coventry in 1722 the foot-soldiers named two persons
and the sheriff returned them.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Whether this be true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>or false it was not until 1735 that the Mutiny Act
provided for the withdrawal of the troops to a distance
of at least two miles from the polling-place during an
election. But it was not so much for their interference
with the free and independent voter as for the burden
which they laid on the innkeeper that the soldiers were
disliked. Whether this burden was really so grievous
or not is beside the question; it was, at any rate,
believed to be intolerable.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> As early as in 1726 the
King had asked for additional powers in the Mutiny
Act to check the evasion by the civil authorities of
their duty of quartering the men, and it was just after
this date that municipalities began to abound in complaints.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
The question was one of extreme difficulty
for the Secretary-at-War, since the outcry of the
civilians was balanced by a no less forcible counter-cry
of officers. Municipalities seemed to think that no
military exigency could excuse the violation of their
comfort. Riots, for instance, were expected at Bath
which, as a watering-place, was exempt from the duty
of finding quarters for soldiers. The Secretary-at-War,
though he did not shrink from sending troops thither
to put down the rioters, looked forward to a disturbance
between the civil and military elements as inevitable.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
Southampton, again, cried out bitterly against the arrival
within her boundaries of a whole regiment of dragoons.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>The colonel retorted that the regiment in question had
been dispersed in single troops ever since its formation,
and that this was actually his first opportunity of reducing
it to order and discipline.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> On some occasions
the officers were certainly to blame, though they appear
rarely to have misbehaved except under extreme provocation.
Thus we find an officer, who had been denied
a guard-room at Cirencester, solving the difficulty by
the annexation of the town hall,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> another still more
arbitrary putting the Recorder of Chester under durance,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
and a cornet of dragoons revenging himself upon an
innkeeper by ordering eight men to march up and down
before the inn for an hour every morning and evening,
in order to disturb the guests and spoil the pavement.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
On one occasion, indeed, we see two officers making
the wealthiest clothier of Trowbridge drunk and enlisting
him as a private.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> These are specimens of the
petty warfare which was waged between soldiers and
civilians all over the kingdom, actions which called forth
pathetic appeals from the Secretary-at-War to the
offenders not to make the Army more unpopular than
it already was. The warning was the more necessary,
since, to use Pulteney's words, giddy insolent officers
fancied they showed zeal for the Government by abusing
those whom they considered to be of the contrary party.
This, however, was but the natural result of making
the Army a counter in the game of party politics. The
only moderating influence was that of the King, who, if
once convinced of any abuses committed by the soldiery
was inexorably severe.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Yet, on the whole, it should seem that soldiers were
far less aggressive towards civilians than civilians towards
soldiers. It is abundantly evident that in many places
the civil population deliberately picked quarrels with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>troops in order to swell the clamour against the Army;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and officials in high local and municipal station, in their
rancour against the red-coats, would stoop to lawlessness
as flagrant as that of the mob. Lord Denbigh falsely
accused the soldiers employed against the famous Black
Gang of poachers, a sufficiently dangerous duty, of
leaguing themselves with them for a share in the profits.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The Mayor of Penzance deliberately obstructed dragoons,
who had been sent down to suppress smuggling, in the
execution of their duty; the inference being that his
worship was the most notorious smuggler on the coast.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The Mayor of Bristol threw every obstacle, technical or
captious, that he could devise, in the way of recruiting
officers.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The Mayor of St. Albans, most disgraceful
of all, took the Secretary-at-War's passes from certain
discharged soldiers, whipped them through the streets,
and gave them vagrant's passes instead, with the result
that the unhappy men were stopped and shut up in gaol
for deserters.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Redress for such injuries as these was
not easily to be obtained; for of what profit could it be
to these poor fellows to speak to them of their legal
remedy? The soldiers were subject to a sterner and
harder law than the civilians, and the civilians never
hesitated to take advantage of it. They thought
nothing of demanding that an officer should be cashiered
unheard, solely on their accusation, and that too when
redress lay open to them in the courts of law.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The
difficulties of the Secretary-at-War in respect of these
complaints are pathetically summarised by Craggs: "If I
take no notice of such things I shall be petitioned against
by twenty and thirty towns; if I inquire into them the
officers think themselves discouraged; if I neglect them
I shall be speeched every day in the House of Commons;
if I give any countenance to them I shall disoblige the
officers. My own opinion is that I can do no greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>service to the Army than when, by taking notice of such
few disorders as will only affect a few, I shall make the
whole body more agreeable to the country and the clamour
against them less popular in the House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>"</p>

<p>With traps deliberately laid to draw the troops into
quarrels, with occasional experience of such brutality as
has been above described, and with members of the
House of Commons incessantly branding soldiers as
lewd, profligate wretches, it is hardly surprising that
there should have been bitter feeling between the Army
and the civil population. But even more mischievous
than this was the tendency of civilians, as of the House
of Commons, to interfere with military discipline. It is
tolerably clear, from the immense prevalence of desertion,
and from the effusive letters of thanks written to
magistrates who did their duty in arresting deserters,
that the great body of these functionaries were in this
respect thoroughly disloyal. Men could hardly respect
their officers when they saw the civil authorities deliberately
conniving at the most serious of military
crimes. But this was by no means all. We find
Members of Parliament interceding for the ringleaders
of a mutiny,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> for deserters,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> for the discharge of soldiers,
sometimes, but not always, with the offer to pay for a
substitute;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and finally, as a climax, we see one honourable
gentleman calmly removing his son from his regiment
on private business without permission either asked
or received.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> And the Secretary-at-War liberates the
mutineers, warns the court-martial to sentence the
deserter to flogging instead of death, since otherwise
interest will procure him a pardon, and begs General
Wade, one of the few officers who had the discipline of
the Army at heart, to overlook the absence of the
member's son without leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>A parallel could be found to all these examples at
this day, it may be said. It is quite possible, for such
ill weeds once sown are not easily eradicated, but the
roots of the evil lay far deeper then than now in the
overpowering supremacy of the Secretary-at-War.
That official throughout this period continued to correspond
directly with every grade of officer from the
colonel to the corporal, whether to give orders, commendation,
or rebuke, wholly ignoring the existence of
superior officers as channels of communication and
discipline.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> His powers in other directions are indicated
by the phrase, "Secretary-at-War's leave of absence,"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
which was granted to subalterns, without the slightest
reference to their colonels, to enable them to vote for
the Government's candidate at by-elections.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> We find
him filling up a vacancy in a regiment without a word
to the colonel,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> instructing individual colonels of
dragoons when they shall turn their horses out to grass,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
and actually giving the parole to the guard during the
King's absence from St. James's.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> All these orders,
relating to purely military matters, were issued, of
course, by the King's authority, though not always in
the King's name; and, indeed, as the volume of work
increased, directions, criticisms, and reproofs tended
more and more to be communicated by a clerk by order
of the Secretary-at-War. In fact, the absolute control
of the Army was usurped by a civilian official who, while
arrogating the exercise of the royal authority, abjured
every tittle of constitutional responsibility.</p>

<p>The result of such a system in such an age as that of
Walpole may be easily imagined. All sense of military
subordination among officers was lost. Their road
to advancement lay, not by faithful performance of their
duty for the improvement of their men and the satisfaction
of their superiors, but by gaining, in what fashion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>soever, the goodwill of the Secretary-at-War,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>&mdash;by
granting this man his discharge, advancing that to the
rank of corporal, pardoning a third the crime of desertion.
"Our generals," said the Duke of Argyll in the
House of Lords at the opening of the Spanish War,
"are only colonels with a higher title, without power
and without command ... restrained by an arbitrary
minister.... Our armies here know no other power
but that of the Secretary-at-War, who directs all their
motions and fills up all vacancies without opposition
and without appeal."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Well might General Wade be
believed when he asserted that the discipline of the
Army was as bad as it could be.</p>

<p class="noindent">From the political I turn to the purely military side of
the Army's history. Treating first of the officers, it
has, I think, been sufficiently shown that there were
influences enough at work to demoralise them quite
apart from any legacies of corruption that they might
have inherited from the past. Against their indiscipline
and dishonesty George the First seems to have set his
face from the very beginning. He had a particular
dislike to the system of purchasing and selling commissions.
If (so ran his argument) an officer is unfit to
serve from his own fault, he ought to be tried and
cashiered, if he is rendered incapable by military service,
he ought to retire on half-pay; and so firm was the
King on this latter point that the Secretary-at-War
dared not disobey him.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> As early, therefore, as in June
1715 the King announced his intention of putting a
stop to the practice, and as a first step forbade all sale
of commissions except by officers who had purchased,
and then only for the price that had originally been
paid. One principal cause that prompted him to this
decision appears to have been the exorbitant price
demanded by colonels, on the plea that they had discharged
regimental debts due for the clothing of the
men, and suffered loss through the carelessness of
agents.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It should seem, however, that as the rule
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>applied only to regiments on the British and not to those
on the Irish Establishment, the desired reforms were
little promoted by this expedient. In 1717, therefore,
the King referred the question to the Board of General
Officers, with, however, a reservation in favour of sale
for the benefit of wounded or superannuated officers,
which could not but vitiate the entire scheme. He
thought it better, therefore, to regulate that which he
could not abolish, and in 1720 issued the first of those
tariffs for the prices of commissions which continued to
appear in the Queen's Regulations until 1870. At the
same time he subjected purchase to certain conditions as
to rank and length of service, adding somewhat later
that the fact of purchase should carry with it no right
to future sale.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Evidently ministers kept before his
eyes not only the usefulness of the system from a
political standpoint, since every officer was bound over
in the price of his commission to good behaviour, but
still more the impossibility of obtaining from Parliament
a vote for ineffective men. They followed, in
fact, the precept of Marlborough, and it is hard to say
that they were not right.</p>

<p>Concurrently the King took steps, not always with
great effect, to check the still existing abuse of false
masters.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> A more real service was the prevention of
illegal deductions from the pay of the men, a vice from
which hardly a regiment was wholly free, by the regulation
of all stoppages by warrant.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> As part of the same
principle, he endeavoured also to ensure honesty towards
the country and towards the soldiery in the matter of
clothing. In fact, wherever the hand of King George
the First can be traced in the administration of the
Army, it is found working for integrity, economy, and
discipline; and it is sufficiently evident that when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>gave decided orders the very officials at the War Office
knew better than to disregard them.</p>

<p>It is melancholy to record the fact that he was ill
supported by the General Officers of the Army. The
Board of Generals, to which the settlement of all purely
military questions was supposed to be referred, seems
to have been lazy and inert, requiring occasionally to
be reminded of its duty in severe terms.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It may well
be that this supineness was due to the general arrogation
of military authority by civilians, but even so it remains
unexcused. Colonels again appear to have been
scandalously negligent and remiss in every respect;
and it may have been as a warning to them that the
King on one occasion dismissed seven of their number
in one batch from his service.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> But issue orders as
he might, the King could never succeed, owing to the
prevailing indiscipline, in making a certain number of
officers ever go near their regiments at all. This habit
of long and continued absence from duty, especially
on colonial stations, is said to have troubled him much,
and to have caused him greater uneasiness than any
other abuse in the Army. It will be seen when we
read of the opening of the Seven Years' War that he
had all too good ground for misgiving. Yet the
regimental officers must not be too hardly judged. In
foreign garrisons, as shall presently be shown, they
were exiles, neglected and uncared for; at home they
were subject to incessant provocation, to malicious
complaints, and in every quarter and at all times
to the control of civilians. Lastly, though frequently
called out in aid of the civil power, they had the
fate of Captain Porteous before their eyes, and indeed
took that lesson so speedily to heart that for want
of their interposition the life of that unlucky man
was sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>When officers flagrantly neglected their duty and
civilians deliberately fostered indiscipline, it is hardly
astonishing that there should have been much misconduct
among the men. It was natural, in the circumstances,
that after the Peace of Utrecht the profession of the
soldier should have fallen in England into disrepute.
The greatest captain of his time, and one of the greatest
of all time, had been rewarded for his transcendent
services with exile and disgrace. Many officers had
quitted the service in disgust, some of them abandoning
even regiments which they loved as their own household.
Wholesale and unscrupulous disbandment did
not mend matters; and the survivors of that disbandment
were confronted with the railings of the House
of Commons, the malice of municipalities, the surliness
of innkeepers and the insults of the populace. The
most honest man in England had but to don the red
coat to be dubbed a lewd profligate wretch. Small
wonder that, clothed with such a character, ready made
and unalterable, soldiers should have made no scruple
of living their life in accordance with it.</p>

<p>The standard of the recruit, socially and morally,
appears at the accession of George the First to have
sunk to the level of the worst days of Elizabeth, of
the Restoration, or of William the Third. It is
abundantly evident that the ranks were filled in great
measure by professional criminals, who passed from
regiment to regiment, spreading everywhere the infection
of discontent, debauchery, and insubordination. The
noxious weeds of desertion and fraudulent enlistment
flourished with amazing exuberance, and no severity
of punishment had power to root them out. Week
after week deserters were brought out into Hyde Park,
tied up to the halberds, or simply to a tree, and flogged
with hundreds of lashes. Every variety of scourging
was tried that ingenuity could suggest. Sometimes the
instrument employed was the cat, sometimes the rod,
sometimes a twig, varied in the case of the cavalry by
cloak-straps and stirrup-leathers. Sometimes the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
regiment did the part of executioners,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> sometimes the
guard, sometimes the drummers only. Sometimes the
culprit ran the gantlope, accomplishing the unpleasant
journey as quickly as he could, sometimes he walked
it with a halberd's point before him, lest he should
hurry unduly. Sometimes he took the whole of his
punishment at one time and place, sometimes in instalments
of a hundred lashes before the quarters of each
detachment of his regiment, a practice akin to "flogging
round the fleet."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Often he received two or three
floggings in as quick succession as the state of his
back would permit, the execution of the sentence being
followed in many cases by "drumming out," with every
circumstance of degradation.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The sentence of death
was often pronounced by courts-martial and not
unfrequently carried out, a deserter convicted for the
third time rarely escaping with his life. Many a man
was shot in Hyde Park during the twenty years
of peace, and no opportunity was lost to enhance the
terror of the penalty, the firing party sometimes consisting
solely of fellow-deserters, who were spared in
consideration of the warning given by the ghastly body
which their own bullets had pierced.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>The newspapers record such matters with little
ceremony, dwelling with greater relish on incidents of
the cart's tail, of the pillory, or of Tyburn. The
picketing of a soldier was indeed for a time a sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>novelty to attract crowds,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> but the interest in the
process appears to have been short-lived. People were
not squeamish in those days, and men would lay a
wager to receive so many hundred lashes without
flinching, as calmly as if it were to run so many miles
or drink so many pots of ale. It is, however, noteworthy
that both of the first of the Guelphic kings
were prone to lighten the sentences of courts-martial,
constantly reducing the number of lashes and remitting
the penalty of death. Whether this was due to policy
or humanity it is a little difficult to determine, for the
populace certainly sympathised with deserters, and
would help to rescue them, while there were "malicious
persons" who were glad to denounce the severity of
military punishments as a reproach against the Government.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
I am, however, inclined to believe that both
kings were inspired by the higher of the two motives,
and should receive due honour for the same. The
like, I believe, can hardly be said of the malicious
persons above named, considering that the House of
Commons had the scandalous evils of the London
prisons before it in 1729, but left the whole work of
reform to be done by John Howard in 1774.</p>

<p>The consequences of filling the ranks with rogues,
together with the evils of indiscipline and neglect, did
not end with desertion and fraudulent enlistment.
That soldiers in their private quarrels should have
fought desperately, wounding and killing each other on
the slightest provocation, is nothing remarkable, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>such encounters were common in the poorer classes of
the urban population. But the newspapers report a
sufficient number of mishaps through the use of loaded
instead of blank cartridges at drill, to show that such
occurrences were not wholly accidental. Again, we
find a corps so much favoured as the First Troop of
Horse Grenadier Guards breaking into open mutiny,
because one of their number was sentenced to the
picket.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> On one very scandalous occasion the officers
in command of the Prince of Wales's guard were so
careless as to allow the troopers to get drunk when
actually in attendance on His Royal Highness. The
guard was turned out, and after some delay three
troopers appeared who, though egregiously tipsy, were
able to stagger to their places and stand more or less
firmly on their legs. "This," we read, "the Prince
complained of as shameful, as well he might"; but at
this distance of time the reader, with the self-important
figure of the prince who became King George the
Second before him, will have no eye except for what
was probably the most ludicrous spectacle ever witnessed
at the Horse Guards.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But the climax of scandal was
reached when a burglary was actually committed in
Kensington Palace, and when, on the calling of the roll
of the guard, but two men were found to be present, the
rest being engaged apparently in rendering assistance to
the burglars.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Certainly the soldiers of some regiments
did their best to merit the bad name which was attached
impartially to all who wore the red coat.</p>

<p>It may be asked why the system of enlistment for
three years, which had produced such excellent results
in Queen Anne's time, should have been abandoned.
The reply, judging from the arguments of a later time,
is that there was apprehension lest men should pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>through the ranks of the British Army to strengthen
those of the Pretender. There are signs that a reintroduction
of the system was talked of in 1731, and
was received by at least one observer with joy at the
prospect of converting the whole nation into a sort of
militia,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but I can find no official trace of such a revival.
If it be asked how the Army survived a period of such
discouragement and distress at all, the answer, I cannot
doubt, is that it was saved, as it has often been saved,
by the spirit, the pride, and the self-respect of individual
regiments. There were always officers who worked
hard and conscientiously for the credit of their own
corps, and always men who were proud to take service
with them and help them to maintain it. After the
Peace of Utrecht, as at the present day, the War Office
did its best to subvert regimental feeling by a return to
the practice, expressly condemned by Marlborough,
of strengthening the weaker corps by drafts from the
stronger, but then as now regimental traditions preserved
the War Office from the consequences of its
own incapacity, and the Army from total dissolution.</p>

<p>So much for purely British affairs: but the British
Empire, then as now, was not bounded by the shores of
the British Isles, and it is necessary to examine next the
broader question of Imperial defence. As the reader
will have gathered in the course of my narrative, the
system of home defence, up to the birth of the New
Model and beyond it, had, apart from the fleet, been
always the same. A few gunners and a few weak
independent companies were maintained rather as caretakers
than as defenders of the fortified places; in the
event of an invasion there was the militia; while in case
of an expedition beyond sea, a special force was raised,
and disbanded as soon as its work was done. The
standing Army gradually swept the independent garrison-companies
out of existence, though there were still a
few at Hampton Court, Windsor, and one or two
similar places in the last year of King William the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Third; but as has already been seen, the standing
Army voted by Parliament just sufficed to furnish
garrisons for the most important British fortresses and
no more. Practically, therefore, the new system differed
little from the old: if England were called upon to
fight an enemy outside her own borders she must still
raise a new army before she could send a man beyond
sea. The only difference was that there were sufficient
skeleton regiments, with their officers complete, to
absorb several thousand men.</p>

<p>In our possessions abroad the old English system
was followed exactly. British colonies were expected to
raise their own militia and to provide for their own
defence, as though each one of them had been an
England in herself; and they fulfilled that expectation
with a readiness which in those days seems astonishing.
In the case of the American colonies, and in particular
of the northern provinces, the problem of forming a
national militia presented little difficulty; for theirs
was a country where the white population could increase
and multiply, and where white children could grow up
to a vigorous manhood. The reader will shortly be able
to judge the American militia by test of active service.
But in the tropical islands of the West Indies, and to
some extent in the southern provinces of Virginia and
Carolina, the conditions were different. There the white
man could not thrive and rear a healthy progeny, while a
horde of negro slaves, sound, strong, and prolific, made
an element of danger which was only kept in awe by
systematic intimidation of almost incredible severity.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Failing the natural increase of a white population,
the ranks of the militia in the West Indies were kept
full by continual exportation of white "servants" from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
England, that is to say, of men, women, and children
saved from the gaol or the gallows, plucked naked and
starving out of the gutter, trepanned by scoundrelly
crimps, or kidnapped bodily in the streets and spirited,
as the phrase went, across the Atlantic. From the
earliest days of English colonisation the seeds to be
sown in the great continent of the West had been
gathered from the weeds that grow by the roadside.
In 1610 three hundred disorderly persons were sent
to Virginia, in 1617 and 1618 a cargo of poor and
impressed emigrants, in 1620 "a parcel of poor and
naughty children." New England, with higher ideals
and a deeper insight than her sisters, resolved to accept
only youths untainted by vice, but even so did not
escape an infusion of the very scum of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> An
enlightened Frenchman did indeed formulate a scheme
for recruiting old soldiers as emigrants for Virginia,
but for the most part the white servants were drawn
almost exclusively from the unprofitable classes.</p>

<p>The Civil War, the conquest of Ireland, the subdual
of Scotland, and the crushing of royalism introduced
a new element into the exported white servants. Irish
men and Irish girls, grouped under the generic name of
Tories, were shipped off to the West Indies by hundreds
and even thousands.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> English and Scottish prisoners
of war, the vanquished of Dunbar and of Worcester
among them, followed the Irish; and, finally, all ranks
of the Royalists who dashed themselves in vain against
the iron will of the Protector, many of them men of
birth and high character, were, in the phrase of the day,
Barbadosed. After the Restoration the supply of white
servants, though swelled for a moment by the rebellion
of Monmouth and by the innocent victims of Jeffreys,
reverted to its dependence on the gaol, the crimp, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>the "spirit." Transportation, though not long obsolete,
has been well-nigh forgotten as a means of penal discipline,
and quite forgotten as the first foundation of our
system of colonial defence.</p>

<p>The white servants might, in the majority of cases,
have been termed white slaves. They were frequently
sold for money at so much a head without the least
concealment, and were granted away in scores both by
Oliver Cromwell and by James the Second as a means
of profit and reward to good servants or to favourites.
The practice was thoroughly recognised; and not a
voice, except that of the younger Vane, was ever raised
against the principle.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Theoretically the white servants
were bound apprentices for a term of years, rarely exceeding
ten, at the close of which they received their
freedom with, as a rule, a grant of Crown-land to encourage
them to settlement.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> During their period of
servitude they were obliged to serve in the ranks of the
colonial militia, not as free men, but as the subjects of
their masters. Every planter was bound by law to
furnish his quota of men, and old colonial muster-rolls
frequently consist only of a list of masters, with a figure
showing the number of servants to be supplied by each
of them, not unlike the provincial muster-rolls of Queen
Elizabeth's day in England. Having furnished their
men to the ranks, the masters took their places at their
head, in such numbers as were required, as their officers.</p>

<p>Three causes conspired to clothe the colonial militia
with an efficiency unknown to the militia of England,&mdash;the
presence of powerful neighbours, native or European;
the knowledge that little help was to be expected from
the mother country; and, in the tropics, the eternal
dread of a rising of the negroes. Barbados, an island
no larger than the Isle of Wight, could at the close of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>King Charles the Second's reign show six regiments of
foot and two of horse, or a total of six thousand men;
while Jamaica, a less fortunate island and a full generation
later in settlement, produced in the same year
seven regiments of four thousand men. Jamaica, it
may be observed, owing to the presence of wild tribes
of runaway slaves called Maroons, lived in more than
ordinary terror of a servile war, and therefore kept her
militia up to a high standard of efficiency. The reader
should take note, in passing, of these Maroons, for we
shall meet with them again at a very critical time.
Even so, colonies frequently observed the true English
spirit of apathy.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The main point, however, is that
each colony, tropical or temperate, made provision for
its own defence in respect of trained men and of fortification.
Magazines were replenished partly by local
laws, which compelled all vessels trading regularly from
England to pay dues of gunpowder in proportion to
their tonnage; the mother country making frequent
grants of guns and of other stores from the depots of
the Ordnance in England, and occasionally doling out
even a small subvention of money. As a rule, moreover,
the Crown was careful to appoint men of some
military experience to be governors, in order that the
local forces might not want a competent commander;
and it is noteworthy, as a curious survival of old military
traditions, that the civilian who performs the functions
of sheriff in the West Indian Islands still bears, in a
great many cases, the title of provost-marshal.</p>

<p>But even in the days of Charles the Second this
primitive method of colonial defence showed signs of
breaking down. At St. Kitts, which island was shared
by the French and English until the Peace of Utrecht,
the French kept a small permanent garrison. The
English were of course bound to do likewise, and accordingly
two independent companies of red-coats were
stationed there at the cost of the Crown&mdash;stationed, not
maintained, for they were left at first without pay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
clothing, or attention of any kind from home, for whole
years together.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In times of emergency such companies
were quartered also in other colonies, such as Jamaica
and Virginia, but these were never retained for longer
than could be helped, the colony receiving the option
of maintaining them at its own expense or of dispensing
with them altogether. As the men were generally
mutinous for want of pay, they sometimes proved to be
an element of danger rather than of security.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Where
settlements were granted out by charter to companies or
to proprietors, the burden of defence of course fell on
them, and was almost invariably borne by a local militia.
There were, however, exceptions, notably the East
Indian and African Companies, which, as they concerned
themselves not with colonisation, but solely with trade,
will be more conveniently discussed elsewhere. New
York, from its supreme importance as a commercial and
strategic station, was provided by its proprietor, James,
Duke of York,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> with two regular independent companies
of English.</p>

<p>Time went on, and the system of defence by
transportation became more and more unstable. White
men, chafing against servitude, ran away from the West
Indian Islands by scores to join the pirates that
swarmed in the Caribbean Seas. The long war from
1689 to 1714 finally cut off the supply of white
servants altogether for a time, every possible recruit
having been seized by the press-gang or by the parish
constable to serve in the regular army or navy. At
the accession of King William the only British garrisons
in the colonies were one company at the Leeward
Islands and two at New York; by 1692 the West
Indies alone had one complete regiment<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> and four
independent companies of red-coats. At the accession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>of Queen Anne the independent companies for a time
disappeared from the West Indies, and gave place to
regular regiments of the Line, which have furnished
the garrison ever since.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Elsewhere, however, the old
principle still held its own. In 1695 two companies
at New York were increased to four, and in 1696
another company took charge of Bermuda and Newfoundland.
The close of the War of the Spanish
Succession found England in exclusive possession of
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Minorca, and Gibraltar,
all of them requiring permanent garrisons, and not one
with the means of providing a militia of its own.</p>

<p>A situation so novel called for an entirely new
departure in English military policy, but no one appears
to have perceived any necessity for the same, possibly
from the conviction that, however clearly a soldier's
eye might see, the eyes of the country and of the
House of Commons would certainly be blinded. The
authorities, therefore, held fast to the tradition of the
Tudors, that the garrison of a strong place must be
irremovably attached to it. Nova Scotia and Newfoundland
required special attention, and were accordingly
furnished with four independent companies apiece, which
in 1717 were merged, by some brilliant inspiration at
headquarters, into a single regiment of ridiculous weakness,
now living in our midst as the Fortieth Foot. The
Leeward Islands having received their regiment of the
Line during the war, were allowed to keep it during
the peace, on condition of providing barracks and
extra pay for all ranks; but a colonial garrison, even
though it were a regiment of the Line, was still a
garrison, and therefore irremovable; and so it came to
pass that the Thirty-eighth Foot remained in the
Leeward Islands unrelieved for sixty years. But meanwhile
it was found indispensable to keep a small
garrison also at Jamaica. The temptation to revert to
the old system was irresistible, so two independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
companies took charge of Port Royal.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Then Carolina
was perceived to require defence, and in 1720 another
independent company was sent there; then the Bahamas
and Bermuda, which had hitherto shared a company
between them, asked for a company apiece and received
them; and at this strength the colonial garrisons remained
until 1735. Then Jamaica was seen to be in
serious peril from a rising of negroes, and everything
pointed to the permanent quartering of a whole regiment
in the Island; but still the old expedient was followed.
Six independent companies were drafted from the
regiments at Gibraltar, making with the two already
in existence a total of eight independent companies;
nor was it until 1743 that these were at last combined
into Trelawny's regiment, or, to give it its modern
name, the Forty-ninth Foot.</p>

<p>But meanwhile, in 1737-38, the needs of a new
colony forced the War Office to provide yet another
garrison for the defence of Georgia; and it was boldly
resolved to form a whole regiment for that service and
for that alone. Its colonel was the governor and
founder of Georgia, General James Oglethorpe; and
it was formed by the simple process of turning over
the whole of the effective privates of the Twenty-fifth
Foot to that estimable man.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This incident marks
the furthest limit to which the principle of separating
Colonial and Imperial service was pushed by the War
Office. Another quarter of a century was to see, not
the impressment of English soldiers for a colonial
regiment, but the embodiment of colonists into an
English, and a famous English, regiment.</p>

<p>But it was not in respect of the localisation of
foreign garrisons only that the War Office showed
itself hide-bound by ancient tradition. The authorities
were amazingly slow to recognise that the conditions
of service at Portsmouth and Annapolis, at Hull and
at Gibraltar, were not and could not be identical. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>a previous chapter I hinted at the neglect which drove
the garrison of Gibraltar to burn their huts for fuel.
The experience of twenty years seems to have taught
the War Office but little, for in 1730 the men were
still without a roof over their heads and suffering
terribly from exposure and from dysentery.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In Minorca
the quarters of the troops were equally bad, the fortifications
were in as ill condition as the quarters, and the
unhappy soldiers begged in vain for new bedding
to replace that which they had fairly worn out by ten
years of service.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> At Annapolis and Placentia the
barracks were falling down; and from Bermuda came
complaints in 1739 that no stores of any kind had
been received since 1696. In New York the tale of
misery and hardship almost passes belief. There, men
on the frontier-guards marched to their posts knee-deep
in snow and lay down in their clothes, for want
of bedding, when relieved: the sergeant having orders to
wake them from time to time, lest they should be frozen
to death in the guard-room. Yet the officers begged
in vain for the supply of their wants. The Office of
Ordnance, in abject fear of swelling the sum of its
estimates, pleaded that Parliament had made no provision
for such services: and the result was that forty-nine
men out of two weak companies perished in a single
winter for lack of a blanket to cover them.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>But the story of helplessness and neglect does not
end here. The War Office appears to have imagined
that all the world over there were, as in England, not
only alehouses, wherein troops could be quartered, but
landlords who would provide them, according to the
tariff of the Mutiny Act, with food, fire, and candle. It
would seem not to have occurred to it that supplies
in an isolated barren fortress like Gibraltar must of
necessity be limited; nor was it until 1720 that, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>King's instance, it was ordered that Gibraltar should
be provided always with victuals for two months in
advance. The feeding of the garrisons there, in Minorca,
in Nova Scotia and in Newfoundland was entrusted to
contractors, but in the contracts the most obvious
necessities were overlooked. Thus, though Minorca was
supplied with brandy, oil, bread, salt, and tobacco, the
item of meat was entirely omitted, and it was actually
necessary for the governor to explain that the five
articles above enumerated were insufficient for the
nourishment of the British soldier.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> At Annapolis&mdash;loneliest,
dullest, and dreariest of quarters&mdash;the soldiers
were expected to content themselves with water for their
only beverage. Not unnaturally they mutinied; and
their officers were fain to purchase molasses at their own
expense and brew them beer.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Deadly though the
climate of the West Indies then was, men could think
themselves fortunate to be quartered there, for Jamaica
and the Leeward Islands showed far more generosity to
the British soldier than the British Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The greatest hardship of service on foreign stations
remains yet to be noticed, namely, the absence of any
system of periodic reliefs. Englishmen did not accept
exile so readily in those days as in these. Ordinary
soldiers did not conceive that they enlisted for service
in foreign garrisons; that duty was for men especially
recruited, as they thought; and they constantly
deserted in sheer despair of ever returning home.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> A
distinguished officer, the Duke of Argyll, went the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>length of saying that a long term of duty at Mahon was
equivalent to a punishment, and that his only surprise
was that the troops had not mutinied both at Minorca
and Gibraltar.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The Board of General Officers urged
the question at least once upon the King,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> but without
result. A still more cruel matter was that the War Office
refused to grant to invalided soldiers a free passage
home. Even in these days of sanitary science the
amount of sickness among our troops in the tropics is
sufficiently great: the reader may calculate for himself
what it must have been when malarial fever, yellow
fever, and smallpox<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> were allowed to run their course
unchecked. But the only answer of the War Office to
an appeal from the Governor of Jamaica for the return
of invalided soldiers was the usual plea of no funds,
urged with something more than the usual warmth of
indignation.</p>

<p>Such petty economies, of course, cost the country
incredibly dear. The hardships of foreign service led
not only to desertion but to extreme difficulty in obtaining
recruits for the independent companies abroad. To
overcome these obstacles three separate devices were
employed. The first was to offer large bounties, which
from between 1720 and 1739 grew swiftly from thirty
shillings to seventy-five.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> This proving very costly,
recourse was made to the mischievous practice of drafting
men from regiments at home, thereby transferring
the expense from the state to the regimental officers, who
were compelled to pay as much as five pounds a head
for the men drafted to them.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The system being simple
was soon carried to outrageous lengths. The bounty
failing to attract recruits for Carolina, a draft of pensioners
was sent out in their place, and the same principle was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>shortly after extended to Gibraltar.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Thus not only
was cruel hardship inflicted on the pensioners, but the
one reserve which England possessed for her defence in
time of emergency was frittered away in service abroad.
Finally, on the rare occasions when a relief was sent to
the Mediterranean garrisons, the relieving regiment was
generally so much weakened by desertion before its
departure that it was necessary to turn over to it bodily
the two junior companies of the relieved, and to call
for volunteers from the remaining companies. If the
requisite men could not be obtained by these means, the
orders were to select as many more as were required by
lot.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The inevitable result was that the garrison was
composed mainly of discontented men, ready to desert
at the first opportunity, with an infusion of lazy,
cunning old soldiers, who had contracted an attachment
to the wine or the women of the country, and were
content to pass the rest of their lives in chronic insobriety.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the whole situation became so
pressing that the Board of General Officers advised the
King to make transportation to service abroad an alternative
penalty for desertion, and to show no mercy in
inflicting it.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> The King declined, nor can it be denied
that there was wisdom in his decision; but it is none
the less certain that abundance of deserters received
pardon on condition of enlisting in corps that were
quartered in the colonies, and particularly in Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
The principle of sending off bad characters to wear
their red coats on the other side of the Atlantic received
final sanction in 1742, when over a hundred mutinous
deserters from a Highland regiment were divided
between the Mediterranean garrisons, the West Indies,
and Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Such a windfall did not come every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>It is now easy to see why foreign service should
have been no less unpopular with officers than with
men. Their soldiers were discontented and miserable
through evils which they had no power to remedy;
their regiments were filled with the worst characters,
for whom they were obliged to pay an extravagant
price; no better provision was made for their comfort
than for that of the men: and the life was insufferably
dull and monotonous. Nothing, however, can excuse
the systematic evasion of duty which was so common
among them, still less the hopeless indiscipline which
nullified the King's repeated orders for their attendance.
Altogether it is clear that England was not yet the
least awake to the fact that she had entered upon
possession of an Empire, and that an Empire must be
defended by the sword. There was no definite scheme
of defence, no attempt to realise the extent of the
country's military resources, no effort to discover how
they might be turned to most effective account. To
live from hand to mouth, from budget to budget, was
sufficient for Robert Walpole, while the King, if ever he
looked beyond the sea, gazed eastward and not westward,
and then not at India, but at Hanover.</p>

<p>It remains for me to mention such improvements
as were effected in the Army during the period under
review, which, though they were few, were none the
less far-reaching. The first was the permanent organisation
of the Artillery. As has been seen, the
Commonwealth latterly maintained a field-train ready
and equipped for the field, while William the Third
improved upon this by distributing the train into two
companies. In the chaos which followed upon the
Peace of Utrecht this organisation was suffered to
collapse, and the Board of Ordnance, when ordered to
fit out a train in 1715, was absolutely unable to do so.
It was therefore determined to revert to the system of
King William by the establishment of four permanent
companies of Artillery, which was duly ordained by
Royal Warrant of 26th May 1716. Two companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
only were created at first, with a total strength of nine
officers and ninety-two men, but the number was increased
to four companies in 1727, with the title of the
Royal Regiment of Artillery, a designation which still
covers about a hundred companies and over a hundred
batteries of garrison, field, and horse artillery. The
first colonel was a foreigner, Albert Borgard by name,
who had entered the British service in time to fight at
Steenkirk, and had afterwards served through the War
of the Succession in Spain, distinguished more than
once by grievous wounds and always by excellent and
honourable service. We shall see that the career of the
corps has been like unto that of its first colonel.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>A second novelty in the Army during this period
has enwoven itself even more closely into its traditions.
In 1725 General Wade was sent up to Scotland armed
with instructions for the disarmament of the Highland
clans, and with statutory powers to send all clansmen
that did not surrender their arms to serve the King in
a red coat beyond sea. Whether any recruits were
obtained by those means is uncertain, for Wade exercised
his authority in a judicious and tactful spirit, and earned
immortality by employing his troops in the construction
of roads, whereby he not only kept them from the
idleness which begets indiscipline, but endowed the
country with a lasting benefit. To enforce the disarmament,
overawe the disaffected, and preserve order
among the clans, there were raised in that same year
four companies of Highlanders, under Captains Lord
Lovat, Sir Duncan Campbell, John Campbell, and
George Grant.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> There had been independent companies
for service in the Highlands since 1710, but these had
been disbanded in 1717, though the officers were subsequently
reappointed. The new companies wore their
national dress, which, as it consisted principally of black,
blue, and green tartan, presented a sombre appearance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>and gained for its wearers the name of the Black
Watch.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The ranks were filled with a number of young men
of respectable families who had joined the corps to gain
the Highlanders' beloved privilege of bearing arms, and
many were wealthy enough to keep their gillies to
attend them in their quarters and to carry their arms
and kits on the march. The privates were taken indiscriminately
from all the clans, but the officers from the
Whig clans only. The service seems to have been
popular, for the companies, though increased almost
immediately from four to six, were within eighteen
months raised to a strength of one hundred and ten
men each. The fact that within the same period they
had worn out their arms by sheer hard work proves
sufficiently that their life was no easy one. At length,
on the 7th of November 1739, orders were issued for the
raising of four additional companies, and for the formation
of a Highland regiment, seven hundred and eighty
strong. The colonel appointed to command them,
John, Earl of Crawford, was suffering at the time from
a wound received in battle against the Turks five
months before at Krotzka,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and was therefore unable to
take immediate charge of them. Finally, a few weeks
later, a sergeant and a private<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> were brought down to
London, the first kilted soldiers ever seen in the capital,
and were duly exhibited to the King, presumably with
satisfaction to his sartorial mind. Thus came into being
the famous regiment which, ranking originally as the
Forty-third of the Line, is still with us as the Forty-second
Highlanders.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>For the rest, it must be noted that with the accession
of a foreign dynasty the Army began early to show
signs of subjection to foreign influence. In not a few
directions the strict German precision of George the
First worked decidedly for good. Before he had been
on the throne two years he instituted a regular system
of inspection of all regiments by General Officers,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and
shortly after, observing that every corps used such
methods of drill as happened to be preferred by the
colonel, he ordered an uniform exercise to be drawn up
for all.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> More curious, however, was his interference
with the arming of the infantry, for while on the one
hand he insisted that every man should carry a sword
as well as a bayonet, a curious old-fashioned prejudice,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
yet within two years he introduced the steel ramrod,
which was the newest of new improvements.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This
steel ramrod is emblematic of much, since it was the
invention of a veteran who had fought among the
Prussian troops throughout Marlborough's campaigns,
Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau, famous in Prussian
history as the "Old Dessauer."</p>

<p>Perforce we must turn our eyes for a moment
towards the military reforms which were going forward
in Prussia under that half-demented, half-inspired
monarch, King Frederick William. Of the really important
lessons which the British learned from him and
from his far greater son, it is not yet time to speak:
for our present purpose it must be remarked, and
remarked not wholly with a light heart, that he was
the first great military tailor that sat on a throne. He
was also, unfortunately, an admirable soldier into
the bargain, and thus has led many monarchs into the
delusion that the most important military manual is the
book of patterns, and that a soldier is made not by
training and discipline but by tape, goose, and shears.
His influence soon made itself felt in England, for as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>early as 1718 we find Colonel Cosby of the Eighteenth
Royal Irish insisting that every man of his regiment
should wear ruffles at the sleeves and bosom of his
shirt;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and three years later, when Frederick William
visited England in person, the grenadiers of the Guards
were bidden to let their whiskers grow, to do him
honour on his arrival.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Thus dawned the era of
powder, pigtail, and tight clothing.</p>

<p>With the accession of King George the Second the
reign of the military tailor in England began in good
earnest. George did not love his brother-in-law,
Frederick William, but he envied him not a little the
reputation of his army. He had little capacity for
military duties beyond the sphere of a sergeant-major,
though he had won his spurs gallantly enough at the
head of a squadron at Oudenarde, but being ambitious
of military distinction he threw himself with all the
enthusiasm of a narrow nature into the pleasing excitement
of dressing his army. Before he had been on the
throne four months he announced his desire that every
regiment should have "fixed clothing," and by a single
edict swept away all lace from the buff belts of the
cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> In the following year the headdress of the
Horse-Grenadiers was altered,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and in the next year
again the Foot Guards were prohibited from wearing
perukes except in case of sickness.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> And so the process
went on, barely interrupted even by war, until finally it
culminated in an elaborate table of regulations as to
colours, clothing, facings, and lace,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> and, to the great
good fortune of posterity, in the depiction of a private
of almost every regiment in the Army.</p>

<p>In such trifles were the great lessons taught by
Marlborough forgotten. The great Duke's mantle had
descended on one man, but even if he had been suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>to wear it, the Secretary-at-War would not have heeded
him the more. Until 1742 he remained obscure, and
meanwhile the better known officers died fast. Cadogan,
the Duke's successor, died in 1726, and was laid with his
great chief in Henry the Seventh's chapel, not with
military pomp, but, by his own express desire, with all
possible privacy. It should seem that he shrank above
all things from even the semblance of a share in his
master's glory. Of the veterans who outlived him,
Lord Orkney and the Duke of Argyll were made field-marshals
in 1736, while Wade, the kindly administrator
of the Highlands, and Lord Stair took their part, as
shall be seen, in the next war. Beyond them no one
knew whither to look for an English general. Some
perhaps counted on little Prince William who, dressed
as a corporal, was often to be seen drilling a miniature
company of the Coldstream Guards,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> not yet dreaming
that he would one day be called the butcher of Culloden.
None thought of looking into a little house at Westerham,
in Kent, where Colonel Edward Wolfe, a veteran
of Flanders, was educating his little son James, a
remarkably ugly boy with a shock of red hair and a
turned-up nose, who had been born to him in 1727.
None guessed again that a natural genius for war lay in
another boy two years older than Wolfe, who was the
scourge of every orchard, the terror of every tradesman,
and the ringleader of all mischief in and about Market
Drayton, and who bore the name of Robert Clive.
Yet these two, the one frail and delicate, the other an
incorrigible scapegrace, were the instruments appointed
to carry on the work begun by Cromwell and by
Marlborough. Marvellous to relate there were still
alive in 1731 two old men, the one a Royalist officer
aged one hundred and eighteen, the other a Puritan
soldier aged one hundred and eleven, who had fought
at the battle of Edgehill and yet shared some few years
of the world with Wolfe and Clive. They had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Oliver Cromwell as a simple captain, and they lived to
see William Pitt gazetted a cornet of horse.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1738.</div>

<p class="noindent">The long reign of Walpole and of peace had endured
for full seventeen years. Session after session, through
difficulty after difficulty, the minister had handled his
charge with consummate dexterity, as a horse-breaker
handles an unbroken colt; lunging or riding the nation
round and round sometimes in a larger, sometimes in a
smaller circle, but except in a circle never permitting
it to move at all. It was a change, and doubtless a
wholesome change, from the erratic course which
England had pursued for the past century, but after
a time it became wearisome. Conscious of health,
vigour, and strength, the nation began to pant for a
wider field and for a rider that would guide it on
some more adventurous career. But though there was
abundance of aspirants to the saddle it was no easy
matter for them to unseat Walpole; their only chance
was to rouse the dumb creature, which he had so cleverly
mastered, to throw him. The terrors of a standing
Army, notwithstanding persistent brandishing of the
old flag and howling of the old cries, had ceased to
terrify, and it was necessary to discover some excitement
of a more formidable kind.</p>

<p>The first signs of coming trouble were seen in
Parliament in the spring of 1738, when there was a
great debate, culminating in an address of both Houses,
respecting Spanish depredations in the South American
seas. The newspapers thereupon did their utmost to
make matters worse by furious attacks upon Spain.
Into the merits of the question it is unnecessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
enter here. The grievances of the English against the
Spaniards in respect of restrictions on trade and of the
right of search, and of Spaniards against English for
evasion of those restrictions, were at least half a century
old; and it is sufficiently evident that both sides alike
had good ground of complaint. The English, in fact,
chafed less against the restrictions themselves than
against the arbitrary and capricious fashion in which
they were enforced, owing to the dishonesty and corruption
of the Spanish authorities. It was a complaint, as
early as in the reign of Charles the Second, that Spanish
governors would encourage British vessels to violate
the regulations for a time in order to make a sudden
swoop on them for their own profit, when they had
been enticed in sufficient numbers to make a remunerative
prize. Altogether, it is only surprising that it
should have needed fifty years, an unscrupulous
Opposition, and a fable of Jenkins's ear to set the two
nations fighting over the question of American trade.</p>

<p>Walpole, for his part, strove his hardest to avert
war, and even came to a convention with Spain as to
the damages which she should pay for injuries inflicted
on British ships; but this was not what the nation
desired. The convention was furiously denounced in
both Houses as a half-hearted measure, and by no
man more vehemently than by William Pitt. The
animosity against Spain was inflamed to the highest
pitch; but amid all the clamour for war the Opposition
did not fail to produce and to support the annual
motion for the reduction of the Army.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The estimates
provided only for a small increase of the garrisons in
the West Indies, Minorca, and Gibraltar; yet this
most obvious of precautions in the prospect of a rupture
with Spain was opposed by the very men who were
shrieking loudest for war. Walpole's unfailing dexterity,
however, carried him triumphantly through the session;
and though half a million was voted for the augmentation
of the forces, he still hoped to prolong the years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of peace, and with them of his own tenure of office.
But meanwhile the proud spirit of Spain had taken
offence at the invectives and insults of the self-styled
patriots in the English Parliament; and when the
plenipotentiaries met in pursuance of the convention
to adjust the regulation of commerce between the two
nations, the Spaniards refused to proceed with the
business unless the right of search, the very point which
had been denied in Parliament, were first admitted.
Walpole had now to choose between resignation and
war, and to his shame he chose war. The open declaration
of hostilities was proclaimed in London on the
19th of October, amid the pealing of joy-bells from
every steeple in the city. "They may ring their bells
now," muttered Walpole, doubtless with memories of
the War Office in Marlborough's day strong upon him,
"they will be wringing their hands before long."</p>

</div>

<p>Already, in the course of the summer, an augmentation
of some five thousand men had been made to
certain regiments of horse and foot both at home and
in colonial garrisons.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Recruits offered themselves in
such abundance that officers could pick their men, and
the enthusiasm for the war spread to all parts of the
kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Seven hundred men were enlisted in
Edinburgh alone; and the Irish, attracted by the offer
of a bounty, came over in numbers to take service,
though only to be met by an order that, as papists,
they should not be admitted.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> The people were, in
fact, intoxicated at the prospect of plundering New
Spain. Not a man called to mind the expedition of
Venables and Penn, nor thought of the thousands who
started with them, big with expectation of gold told
up in bags, and had never returned. In November
the King opened Parliament, and, having announced
the increase already made to the forces, declared his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>intention of raising several corps of marines, and left
the Commons to debate upon the same. Then the
old instinct of faction at once recovered strength.
Though war had actually been declared, the proposal
was severely criticised as an insidious augmentation of
the standing Army. Pulteney declined to distinguish
between marines and land-forces, as if the point could
at the moment have been of the slightest importance;
several members expressed their hope that the marines
would at least be drafted from the standing Army, and
an address to the King to that effect actually found
ninety-five supporters. Finally, old Shippen, for the
twenty-third time, brought forward his annual motion
for the reduction of the Army. These were the men
who had brought on the war, and this was the way in
which they prepared to support it.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> When it is
remembered that these creatures claimed the name
of patriots, it is hardly surprising that patriotism
should have found a definition as the last refuge of a
scoundrel.</p>

<p>However, orders were issued for the formation of
six regiments of marines,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> under Colonels Wolfe,
Robinson, Lowther, Wynyard, Douglas, and Moreton,
with a strength of eleven hundred men apiece; and
either in deference to the House of Commons, or
possibly for greater despatch, these corps were actually
filled mainly by drafts from existing regiments, as the
event was to prove, with disastrous results.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Meanwhile
Admiral Vernon's squadron in the West Indies
attacked Porto Bello, and having blown up the defences
returned triumphant to Jamaica. This piece of work
was undoubtedly well done, but the exploit was
magnified in England as though Vernon had captured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>the whole of Spanish America. When a nation goes
to war with a light heart it must needs exaggerate the
most trifling success; and Vernon became the hero
not only of the hour but of the whole war, once again
with disastrous results. Elated by his good fortune,
the Admiral three months later made an attempt on
Carthagena, but found that the capture of the port
was a task beyond the strength of his squadron, or
indeed of any squadron without the assistance of seven
or eight thousand troops. His report, however,
indicated the spot where a blow might be struck in
earnest at Spain, and to his influence must be ascribed
the choice of the field of operations.</p>

<p>The Government now girded itself for a serious
effort against New Spain, and decided, like Cromwell,
that New as well as Old England should take a share
in the conflict. Directions were accordingly issued for
the raising of four battalions of Americans under the
colonelcy of Deputy-Governor Spotswood of Virginia;
the recruiting sergeant was set to work on both sides of
the Atlantic; and all through the summer preparations
went forward for a secret expedition. It was hoped
that it would sail for its destination at the end of June
or the beginning of July, that being declared by experts
to be the latest possible date at which operations could
be conducted with any hope of success.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In April the
regiments appointed for the service began to assemble
in the Isle of Wight, and all was bustle and activity.
There was not a little difficulty with these troops, for
the new regiments of marines were remarkable neither
for drill nor discipline; but by the energy of Brigadier-General
Wentworth they were licked into shape with
creditable rapidity. Lord Cathcart, who had been
selected for the chief command, was indefatigably
vigilant, and indeed he had good cause, for the ignorance
and stupidity of the authorities with whom he had
to deal was almost incredible. Thus, for instance, the
War Office, having depleted regiments of the Line to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
make up the new corps of marines, did not hesitate to
order one of the regiments so depleted upon active
service; and Cathcart, bound as he knew to a deadly
climate in the heart of the tropics, found that part of
the force allotted to him consisted of boys who had not
strength to handle their arms.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Such were the first-fruits
of the cry of "No Standing Army."</p>

<div class="sidenote">

</span>.
</div>

<p>By intense labour the military officers sifted out this
unpromising material and turned the residue to the best
account, struggling manfully and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'not unsucessfully'">not unsuccessfully</ins> to
have all ready for the expedition to start in July.
Moreover, on the death of Colonel Spotswood, the intended
second in command, Lord Cathcart begged that
his place might be filled by Brigadier Wentworth, as a
reward for the diligence and the capacity which he had
shown in the camp.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The request was duly granted,
with very tragical consequences. At the same time,
however, the General discovered that, although it was
now late in July, the Admiral who was to escort his
transports had no orders to sail, while his fleet was not
even so much as manned.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> None the less he pushed
his preparations strenuously forward, and, choosing the
anniversary of Blenheim as a day of good omen for the
embarkation, put eight regiments of six thousand men
on board ship.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Then came vexatious delays, due partly
to foul winds, partly to official blundering. Three times
the ships got under way, the men cheering loudly at
the prospect of sailing at last, and three times the wind
failed them or turned foul. Cathcart grew more and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>more anxious. The favourable season was slipping
away fast. The men had been cooped up in the transports
for six weeks and had consumed most of the
victuals intended for the voyage. Scorbutic sickness
was seriously prevalent, and there had already been
sixty deaths. "Surely," wrote the General, "some fresh
meat might be given to the troops"; but the authorities
had given no thought to such matters. August passed
away and September came, bringing with it the news
that a Spanish fleet had put to sea, and that a French
fleet also was about to sail from Brest. France had
already manifested sympathy with Spain, as was natural
from one Bourbon king to another, and the intentions
of the ships from Brest might well be hostile. Such a
contingency might have been foreseen, but it was not;
so there was further delay while the British fleet was
reinforced. Then, when the ships were ready, men
could not be found to man them. Two old regiments
of the Line, the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-sixth, were
turned over to the fleet to make up its complement;
but these were insufficient, and Cathcart was ordered to
send six hundred of his marines also to the men-of-war.
He obeyed, not without warning the Government that
an infectious fever, which had already proved terribly
fatal, was raging in the fleet; but his warning was not
heeded, possibly in the pressure of business could not
be heeded. So the days dragged on; the transports
waited, and the men died. Cathcart's patience was
strained almost beyond endurance. Apart from the
trouble with army and fleet, an endless shower of vexations
poured on him from Whitehall. His instructions
were constantly altered, and no effort was made to keep
his destination unknown. One statement which was
communicated to him as an important secret had been
the talk of all the coffee-houses in Portsmouth long
before it reached him. The newspapers published
details of every ship-load of arms and stores that was

<p>At length, on the 4th of November, the fleet sailed,
just four months too late, and after a very stormy
passage, which scattered the ships in all directions, the
bulk of the transports arrived at St. Rupert's Bay,
Dominica, on the 3rd of January 1741. Already the
force had suffered heavy losses. The fleet was very
sickly, over one hundred soldiers had died, and worst
of all, Lord Cathcart himself had been seized with
dysentery and was also dead.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Wentworth assumed
the command in his stead; and the fleet after a day or
two proceeded to St. Kitts, where all the missing ships
were found at anchor safe and sound. But among them
too sickness had made sad havoc, and of the six
hundred marines transferred despite Cathcart's warnings
to the men-of-war, many were dead and few fit for
duty. From thence the fleet sailed, as had been appointed,
for Jamaica, where it found Vernon's squadron
awaiting it in the harbour, and the American battalions,
now regimented under the command of Colonel Gooch,
in camp on the island. The Americans were in a
very bad state. Their ranks had been filled without
difficulty, but with bad material: they were guiltless of
drill or discipline, and on arrival at Jamaica had at once
become disorderly and mutinous. There was good
excuse for their discontent, for the English Government,
though it had made arrangements for the payment and
victualling of the British troops, had made none whatever
for the Americans, who were thus compelled to fall back
on such meagre resources as Jamaica could provide.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Moreover, the Americans were even more sickly than
the British, and had buried scores of men since their
disembarkation. By the first returns sent home from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>Jamaica it appears that of the nine thousand soldiers
who had started from England and America in October,
seventeen officers and six hundred men had died before
the end of the year, while fifteen hundred more were
actually on the sick-list.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Still the survivors remained in good spirits. There
was for the present all possible harmony between army
and navy,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> and the losses could to some extent be made
good by embarking the four independent companies
which lay in garrison in Jamaica. But meanwhile the
French fleet was concentrated off the coast of Hispaniola,
and until it should be dispersed the commanders
dared not undertake any operations against the Spanish
Main. It is true that France and England were not at
open war; but this, as shall presently be seen, was no
reason why the fleets and armies of the two nations
should not fight each other. When, therefore, the fleet
at last sailed from Jamaica on the 7th of March, Vernon
was fully resolved to attack the French if he should fall
in with them.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> He was, however, relieved of any such
responsibility. Sickness had driven the French fleet
back from the Caribbean Sea to Brest, and the British
were free to go whither they would. It was thereupon
decided to attack Carthagena without delay, for though
Cathcart's instructions gave Wentworth the option of
first attempting Havana, yet the Cuban port was considered
to be too well defended, whereas Carthagena
would, it was hoped, fall an easy prey. The fact was
that Vernon had set his heart on Carthagena, and he
found little difficulty in carrying his point.</p>

<p>On the 15th of March, accordingly, the fleet anchored
at Playa Grande, two leagues to windward of Carthagena,
and the English commanders could judge of the work
before them. The city of Carthagena lies at the head
of an inland lake, which extends at its greatest length
for some seven miles north and south. To this lake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>there are two entrances, of which the eastern, known
from its narrowness as the Boca Chica or Little Mouth,
alone was practicable for line-of-battle ships. The
western side of the Boca Chica was defended by three
forts&mdash;St. Jago and San Felipe at the entrance from the
sea, and Fort Boca Chica, a far more formidable work,
half way up the passage. On the eastern side a fascine-battery
had been thrown up at the entrance, while
another stronghold, Fort St. Joseph, sealed up the inner
end. To force the Boca Chica so as to admit the fleet
to the harbour was the first task to be accomplished by
Wentworth and Vernon.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 20th of March a portion of the squadron,
under Admiral Sir Chaloner Ogle, battered down the forts
of St. Jago and San Felipe; three hundred grenadiers
were successfully landed on the western shore of the
Boca Chica; and on the 22nd the whole of the land-forces
were disembarked excepting the Thirty-fourth,
the Thirty-sixth, and the Americans, of which last,
owing to their indiscipline, but three hundred were
trusted ashore. From the moment of disembarkation
Wentworth seems to have lost his head. He knew his
profession by book, but he was wholly without experience.
Though encamped on an island surrounded
everywhere by at least a league of water, he lived in
mortal terror of a surprise, and posted guards so
numerous and so strong that he could hardly find men
to relieve them. Vernon and Ogle watched him with
amazement for two days, and then losing all patience
sent him a letter, the first of a very remarkable series
that was to pass between Admirals and General before
Carthagena. "Push forward part of your force to
Fort Boca Chica," they said in effect, "put the rest of
your men under canvas, hasten your engineers to the
siege of the fort, and choose a few picked men for your
guards instead of harassing your whole army."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It was
excellent if elementary advice, though hardly such as a
General looks for from an Admiral.</p>

</span></div>

<p>Wentworth, to do him justice, seems to have taken
this counsel in good part, but the delay in opening the
siege of Fort Boca Chica was not altogether his fault.
There was but one engineer in the whole army who was
the least competent to carry on a siege, and there seems
to have been considerable difficulty, first in getting him
to the scene of action at all, and secondly in making
him work when he reached it.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Ground was broken at
last on 23rd March, but when the batteries had been
built, there were so few efficient artillerymen with the
army that Vernon's seamen were perforce borrowed to
work the guns. Finally, on the 2nd of April Wentworth
opened fire; and then it was discovered that by some
mistake the camp had been pitched directly in the same
straight line with the battery, so that every shot from
Fort Boca Chica that flew over the British guns fell
among the tents, killing and wounding over a hundred
men on the first day. Nevertheless, with the help of a
furious cannonade from some of the men-of-war, the
guns of Fort Boca Chica were silenced, and then Vernon
and Ogle began again to stir up Wentworth to action.
"We hope," they wrote on the 3rd of April, "that you
will order your troops to make a lodgment under Boca
Chica to-night ... the longer you delay, the harder
your work will be." Wentworth hesitated, and nothing
was done. "You ought to storm the fort to-night
before the moon rises," they wrote again on the 4th.
Wentworth still hesitated, and another day was lost.
Then the naval officers became more peremptory.
"Diffidence of your troops," they wrote, "can only
discourage them. In our opinion you have quite men
enough for the attack of so paltry a fort. You should
have built another battery, for your men would be all
the healthier for more work. Knowing the climate, we
advise you to pursue more vigorous measures in order
to keep your men from sickness."</p>

<p>The tone of the two sailors towards the soldier was
rather that of a contemptuous nurse towards a timid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
child, but the last letter had the desired effect, for
Wentworth ordered the fort to be stormed on the very
same day. The English no sooner mounted the breach
than the Spaniards fled almost without firing a shot, and
the dreaded fort of Boca Chica fell into Wentworth's
hands at the cost of two men wounded. Moreover, the
Spaniards in the forts on the other side of the channel
also partook in the panic and abandoned them, leaving
the entrance to the harbour open to the British. The
operations so far had cost one hundred and thirty men
killed and wounded, but two hundred and fifty had
perished from sickness, and over six hundred were in
hospital. The rest of the work needed to be done
quickly if it were to be done at all.</p>

<p>It was, however, first necessary to re-embark all the
troops in order to carry them to the head of the harbour
for the attack on the city of Carthagena. This process
occupied more than a week, and did not improve
relations between army and navy. Vernon had already
complained loudly, and probably with some justice, of
the laziness of the soldiers: the blue-jackets had done
all the hard work at the first landing of the regiments,
and they were now called upon to do it again. At
length, however, the transports got under way and
proceeded towards the inner harbour, the entrance to
which, like that of the outer port, lay through a narrow
channel with a large fort, called the Castillo Grande, on
one side, and a small redoubt on the other. The
passage was more effectually blocked by a number of
sunken ships which the Spaniards had scuttled after the
forcing of Boca Chica. The fleet, however, quickly
disposed of all these obstacles. The Spaniards abandoned
Castillo Grande, and the naval officers, with their
usual deftness, contrived to find a channel through the
sunken ships. A few broadsides cleared the beach for
the disembarkation, and on the 16th of April Wentworth
landed. He had begged hard for five thousand men,
but had been answered curtly, though not unjustly, by
the naval commanders that, while they were ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
land them if required, they thought fifteen hundred
men quite sufficient, since time above all things was
precious.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> So with fifteen hundred men Wentworth
proceeded to the further task before him. There was
now but one outwork between him and Carthagena, a
fort standing on an eminence about seventy feet above
the plain, and called Fort St. Lazar. The approach to
it from the head of the harbour lay through a narrow
defile, at the mouth of which the Spaniards offered some
slight resistance. They soon gave way on the advance
of the British, but poor Wentworth, always a General by
book, with his head full of ambuscades and other traps
for the unwary, halted his men instead of pushing on
boldly, or he would almost certainly have carried Fort
St. Lazar then and there, and broken into Carthagena
itself on the backs of the fugitives. Vernon had urged
upon him on the day before that he had only to act
vigorously to ensure success, but Wentworth was far too
much oppressed by the responsibilities of command to
avail himself of such sound advice. He advanced no
further than to within a league of St. Lazar, encamped,
and pressed the Admiral to send him the remainder of
his men.</p>

<p>Vernon acceded to the request, but with no very
good grace. "I send the men," he wrote, "but I still
think such a number unnecessary. Delay is your worst
enemy; their engineers are better than yours, and a
vigorous push is your best chance. No time should be
lost in cutting off the communication between the town
and the surrounding country. We hope that you will
be master of St. Lazar to-morrow." The advice was
sounder than ever, but Wentworth could not nerve
himself to act on it. Shielding himself behind the vote
of a council of war, he replied that the escalade of St.
Lazar was impossible; the walls were too high and the
ditch too deep. Would it not be possible, he asked,
for the ships to batter the fort and sweep the isthmus
that divided the town from the surrounding country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for him. This was too much. The fleet had borne
the brunt of the work so far, but it could not do everything.
Vernon's tone, always overbearing, now became
almost violent. "Pointis,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> who knew the climate, tried
the escalade and succeeded," he retorted, "the ships
can do no more. If you had advanced at once when
the Spaniards fled from you, we believe that you would
have taken St. Lazar on the spot."</p>

<p>After digesting this unpalatable document for a day
Wentworth decided after all for an escalade. Though
he lacked Vernon's experience of the tropics he had a
sufficient dread of the rainy season, which had already
sent sickness into his camp to herald its approach. By
some mischance, for which he disclaimed responsibility,
neither tents nor tools were landed with the men;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and
for three nights the troops, young, raw and shiftless,
were compelled to bivouac. On the third day they
began to fall down fast. A council of war was held,
and although General Blakeney, an excellent officer,
opposed the project to the last, it was decided to carry
St. Lazar by assault. The fort indeed was nothing
very formidable in itself, and could have been knocked
to pieces without difficulty from another eminence called
La Popa, about three hundred yards from it. The
only engineer, however, had been killed before Boca
Chica was taken, the artillerymen were wholly ignorant
of their duty, and the tools had not been landed; so that
although a battery on La Popa would have served the
double purpose of destroying St. Lazar and battering
the walls of the city, no attempt was made to erect it.
And meanwhile the Spaniards had made use of their
respite to strengthen St. Lazar by new entrenchments
which were far from despicable, and had reinforced the
garrison from the town. There, however, the matter
was; and the problem, though it might be difficult in
itself, was so far simple in that it admitted of but one
solution. St. Lazar was practically inaccessible except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>on the side of the town, where it was commanded by
the guns of Carthagena. The fort must, therefore, be
carried from that side before daylight, and carried as
quickly as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
April <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">9</span>
  <span class="blka over">20</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the 20th of April the
columns of attack were formed. First came an advanced
party of fifty men backed by four hundred and
fifty grenadiers under Colonel Wynyard, then the two
old regiments, the Fifteenth and Twenty-fourth, jointly
one thousand strong; after them a mixed company of
the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-sixth; then the Americans
with woolpacks and scaling-ladders, and finally a reserve
of five hundred of Wolfe's marines. The design was
to assault the north and south sides of St. Lazar
simultaneously, Wynyard taking the southern or weaker
face, while Colonel Grant with the old regiments, on
which Wentworth principally relied, assaulted the
northern. A couple of Spanish deserters were at hand
to guide the columns to their respective positions.</p>

<p>At four o'clock the march began, the fireflies still
flickering overhead against the darkness, the air close
and still, and alive with the chirping, whistling, and
croaking of the noisy tropic night. Within the camp
men were lying in scores under the scourge of yellow
fever, some tossing and raving in delirium, some
gasping in the agonies of the last fatal symptom, some
prostrate in helpless and ghastly collapse, waiting only
for the dead hour before the dawn when they should
die. These were left behind, and the red columns
disappeared silently into the darkness. Before long
Wynyard's men reached the foot of the hill and began
the ascent. The ground before them was so steep that
they were forced to climb upon their hands and knees,
and the officers began to doubt whether their guides
might not have played them false. Still the grenadiers
scrambled on almost to the top of the hill, and then
suddenly, at a range of thirty yards, the Spaniards opened
a deadly fire. Now was the time for a rush, which
would have swept the Spaniards pell-mell from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
entrenchments. One man with the traditions of Cutts
the Salamander would have carried the fort in two
minutes; a few score of undisciplined Highlanders
with naked broadswords would have mastered it even
without a leader; but the officers had no experience
except of the parade ground. They were conscious of
a heavy fire in front and flanks, so they wheeled their
platoons outwards to right and left for "street-firing,"
as it was called, and advanced slowly in perfect order,
the men firing steadily at the flashes of cannon and
musketry that blazed before them over the parapet.
Raked through and through by grape and round shot,
the soldiers stood without flinching for a moment, and
loaded and fired as they had been taught, while the
grenadiers lit their fuses coolly and hurled their hand-grenades
into the belt of flame before them. They did
not know, poor fellows, that the grenades provided for
them were so thick, owing to the negligence of the
authorities of the Ordnance, that not one in three of
them would burst. So Wynyard's column fired dutifully
on, though the men that composed it were mown
down like grass.</p>

<p>On the northern face of the hill, where Grant's
column was engaged, a like tragedy was enacted.
Grant himself was shot down early, and after his fall no
man seemed to know what should be done. The men
faced the fire gallantly enough and returned it with
perfect order and steadiness, but without effect. There
were calls for the woolpacks and scaling-ladders, but
the undisciplined Americans had long since thrown
them down and fled; and even had the ladders been
forthcoming they were too short by ten feet to be of
use. There were appeals for guns to silence the Spanish
artillery, but these had been placed in the rear of the
columns and were not to be brought forward. So for
more than an hour this tragical fight went on. Day
dawned at length; the light grew strong, and the guns
of Carthagena opened fire on Grant's column with
terrible effect. Still the English stood firm and fired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
away their ammunition. It was all that they had been
bidden to do, and they did it. Wynyard, his grenadiers
once thrown into action, seemed incapable of bringing
up other troops to support them. General Guise, who
was in charge of the combined attack, showed magnificent
courage and set a superb example, but it was something
more than courage that was wanted. It was now
broad daylight, and the Spaniards began with unerring
aim to pick off the English officers. Finally, a column
of Spanish infantry issued from the gates of Carthagena
to cut off the English from their ships, and at last at
eight o'clock Wentworth gave the order to retire,
Wolfe's marines coming forward to cover the retreat.
The troops had been suffering massacre for close on
three hours, but until that moment not a man turned
his back. There was no pursuit and the retreat was
conducted in good order; but the troops, who had
borne up hitherto against hardship and sickness, were
thoroughly and hopelessly disheartened.</p>

  <span class="blka over">25</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>The losses in the assault were very heavy. Of the
fifteen hundred English engaged, forty-three officers
and over six hundred men were killed and wounded,
and the Fifteenth and Twenty-fourth both lost over a
fourth of their numbers. The treachery of the guides
was answerable for much, but the mismanagement of
the officers was responsible for more. Colonel Grant
was picked up alive, indeed, but desperately wounded.
"The General ought to hang the guides and the King
ought to hang the General," he gasped out in his agony;
and a few hours later he was dead. Wentworth, striving
hard to put a good face on the disaster, ordered a
battery to be erected against Fort St. Lazar on that
same evening; but by this time yellow fever had seized
hold of the army in good earnest, and it was a question
not of building batteries but of digging graves. On
the 21st the General called a council of war and announced
to the Admiral its decision that the number of
men was insufficient for the work, and that the enterprise
must be abandoned. "Since the engineers or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
pretended engineers of the army declare that they do
not know how to raise a battery, we agree," answered
Vernon and Ogle, "though if our advice had been
taken we believe that the town might have fallen."
Then with studied insolence of tone they proceeded to
offer a few obvious suggestions for the withdrawal of
the troops. The military officers, not a little hurt,
remonstrated in mild terms against the taunt, and after
a short wrangle Wentworth requested a general council
of war, by which it was finally determined that the attack
on Carthagena must be given up as impracticable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
April <span class="blkb">

  <span class="blka over">28</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>It was indeed high time. Between the morning of
Tuesday the 18th and the night of Friday the 21st of
April the troops had dwindled from sixty-six hundred
to thirty-two hundred effective men. The two old
regiments had been much shattered in the attack of
St. Lazar, and the residue of the British force consisted
chiefly of young soldiers, while the twelve hundred
Americans who still survived were distrusted by the
whole army, and were in fact little better than an encumbrance.
On the 28th the troops were re-embarked,
poor Wentworth being careful to carry away every
scrap of material lest the Spaniards should boast of
trophies. The naval officers grudgingly consented to
blow up the defences of Boca Chica, and then for ten
terrible days the transports lay idle in the harbour of
Carthagena.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">April 24</span>
  <span class="blka over">May 5.</span>
</span></div>

<p>The horrors of that time are quite indescribable.
By the care of Cathcart hospital-ships had indeed been
provided for the expedition, but these had neither
nurses, surgeons, cooks, nor provisions. "The men,"
wrote Smollett, himself a surgeon on board a man-of-war,
"were pent up between decks in small vessels
where they had not room to sit upright; they wallowed
in filth; myriads of maggots were hatched in the putrefaction
of their sores, which had no other dressing than
that of being washed by themselves in their own allowance
of brandy; and nothing was heard but groans and
lamentations and the language of despair invoking death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to deliver them from their miseries." So these poor
fellows lay in this sickly, stifling atmosphere, with the
raging thirst of fever upon them, while the tropical sun
burnt fiercely overhead or the tropical rain poured down
in a dense, gray stream, filling the air with that close
clammy heat which even by a healthy man is grievous
to be borne. The sailors also suffered much, though
less heavily, being many of them acclimatised; and
surgeons could have been spared from the men-of-war
for the transports could Wentworth have been brought
to ask them of Vernon, or Vernon to offer them to
Wentworth. So while the commanders quarrelled the
soldiers perished. Officers died as fast as the men, all
discipline on the transports came to an end, and the
men gave themselves up to that abandoned listlessness
which was seen in Schomberg's camp in Ireland, when
the bodies of dead comrades were used to stop the
draughts in the tents. Day after day the sailors rowed
ashore to bury their boats' loads of corpses, for there
was always order and discipline in the ships of war;
but the raw soldiers simply dragged their dead comrades
up on deck and dropped them overboard, without so
much as a shroud to their bodies or a shot to their
heels. Vernon railed furiously at this nastiness, as he
called it,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> not reflecting that men untrained to the sea
might know no better. So after a few hours the bodies
that had sunk beneath the water came up again to the
surface and floated, hideous and ghastly beyond description,
about the transports, while schools of sharks
jostled each other in the scramble to tear them limb from
limb, and foul birds with ugly, ragged wings flapped
heavily above them croaking for their share. Thus the
air was still further poisoned, sickness increased, and
the harbour became as a charnel-house. At length, on
the 5th of May, it was resolved to return to Jamaica;
and two days later the fleet sailed away from the horrors
of Carthagena. By that time the men nominally fit for
service were reduced to seventeen hundred, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
not above a thousand were in a condition to be landed
against an enemy.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Arrived at Jamaica the commanders deliberated as
to what should next be done. There were still men
enough, it was thought, for a successful descent upon
Cuba, though the British regiments were terribly short
of officers, having lost over one hundred since they had
left England. But the plague was not stayed by the
removal to Jamaica. Within the month that elapsed
after the abandonment of Carthagena eleven hundred
men died; the strength of the British was reduced to
fourteen hundred, and of the Americans to thirteen
hundred, men.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> For the next three weeks the troops
continued to die at the rate of one hundred a week,
the Americans, as always throughout this expedition,
perishing even more rapidly than the British. At last,
after long disputes, it was decided to make an attempt
upon Santiago de Cuba. The fleet sailed on the 23rd
of August, and on the 29th anchored on the north
coast of the island, in a bay which Vernon, in honour
of Prince William, named Cumberland Haven.</p>

<p>Then the Admiral again came forward with the
same advice as he had offered at Carthagena. He
urged Wentworth to take a picked force of a thousand
men only, together with a thousand bearers, and with
this column to make a forced march and take Santiago
by surprise, the fleet meanwhile co-operating by sea. In
the hands of an enterprising commander it is possible
that such a plan might have succeeded; it was in fact
just such a stroke as had been beloved of Drake and of
the greatest of the buccaneers, but it was beyond the
spirit of Wentworth. The risk indeed was great. The
town lay ninety miles distant from Cumberland Haven,
the only road was a path cut through the jungle, and
there were rivers on the way which a few hours of rain
might render impassable whether for advance or retreat.
In a word Wentworth would have none of such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>ventures. The ill-feeling between army and navy was
embittered; the troops lay idle in their camp, and,
worst of all, sickness increased rather than abated at
the close of the rainy season. By the middle of
November there were hardly sufficient men to supply
reliefs for the ordinary guards, and at the beginning of
December there were less than three hundred privates
fit for duty. A council of war was called, and it was
decided to re-embark the troops for Jamaica, whither
Wentworth, despite violent protests from Vernon,
decided to accompany them.</p>

<p>Still the curtain was not yet to fall on this awful
drama. The military force was now so much reduced
that four of the eight regiments were drafted into the
other four, and only the Fifteenth, Twenty-fourth,
Wolfe's, and Fraser's were left. The yellow fever
continued to rage unchecked. Two hundred and fifty
of the men left in hospital by Wentworth on his
departure for Cuba died in a single fortnight.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Then
in February 1742 there came a reinforcement of three
thousand men, namely, one battalion of the Royal
Scots, the Sixth, and the Twenty-seventh Foot. They
arrived healthy, but began to sicken at once.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> All
kinds of new projects were now debated, an attack on
Guatemala, on Yucatan, on Panama; but the troops
continued to die at the rate of fifteen men a day, and
it was of little profit to discuss plans in the presence
of such a general as yellow fever. At length, after
much delay, the expedition put to sea for the third
time, and sailed against Porto Bello. The voyage was
protracted by inclement weather to nineteen days, and
at the end of those nineteen days, although none but
healthy and selected men had been embarked, the Sixth
regiment alone had thrown ninety-eight corpses overboard,
and of the whole force nearly a thousand were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>sick or dead.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> In such circumstances the enterprise
was abandoned, and the expedition, once more delayed
by unfavourable weather, returned again to Jamaica.
There the hospitals were emptier and the graveyards
fuller than at Wentworth's departure, for five hundred
of the sick which he had left behind him had succumbed.
The survivors who returned from Porto Bello soon
filled up the hospital again, and by the end of July it
was crowded with eight hundred men. One hundred
and fifty of these died in August, and three hundred
more were dead by the middle of October. By this
time such few men as remained of the four thousand
Americans had been discharged, the survivors numbering
little more than three hundred, and all hope of further
operations had been abandoned. The commanders
indeed still met and discussed their plans with each
other and with Governor Trelawny, the contention
growing so hot between them that Trelawny and Sir
Chaloner Ogle drew their swords upon each other, and
were with difficulty prevented by Wentworth from
adding to the death-roll. But when yellow fever is
killing men before they can arrive within range to kill
each other, councils of war are even less than ordinarily
profitable. Of the regiments that had sailed from St.
Helen's under Cathcart in all the pride and confidence
of strength, nine men in every ten had perished.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>A great historian has asked, When did this Spanish
war end?<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and the answer is that it ended imperceptibly
in the gradual annihilation of the contending
armies by yellow fever. The French fleet was driven
back to France by it, the Spaniards were left defenceless
by it, the English were palsied for attack by it. There
was indeed desultory fighting, not without incidents of
signal gallantry, between the colonists of Carolina and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Georgia and their Spanish neighbours in Florida, but
the operations were too trifling to merit record in this
place. The one gleam of light in the whole dark
history is the heroic voyage of Anson, who had been
sent round Cape Horn, with some vague idea that his
fleet and Vernon's should co-operate in attacks on
Central America. In Anson's fame the Army also
has some faint though melancholy share, for about
three hundred Chelsea pensioners, weak, aged, and
infirm, were barbarously driven on board his ships,
nominally to man them, but in reality only to find at
sea the grave which past service should have ensured
them on English soil. Whether with Anson or with
Vernon, whether on the Atlantic or the Pacific, the
war had nothing but failure and death for the red-coats.</p>

<p>It remains to say something of the human share
in the catastrophe of the expedition to Carthagena.
Wentworth has hitherto been made the scapegoat for
every misfortune, and it is probable that he must
remain so; yet the blame of the avoidable disasters
must not be laid wholly to his charge. So far as he
had been tried up to the time of his command he had
proved himself a diligent and painstaking officer; he
had been installed as Cathcart's second by Cathcart's
own request, and could he have remained a subordinate
would probably have done well enough. Though
lacking experience of active service, in or out of the
tropics, he did his best to make good the deficiency by
consulting those officers who knew more than himself.
He tried his hardest to work in concert with the naval
officers, and never wrote home a word of complaint
against Vernon until he had endured his arrogant and
overbearing tone for more than a year. But his own
training, like that of his men, had been mechanical
only, and he could neither rise above the stiff formalities
of his profession himself, nor raise his men above them.
It will be seen that this same mechanical training
could produce astonishing results on the familiar battlegrounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of Flanders, but it was out of place on the
Spanish Main, as it was soon to prove itself out of
place on the Ohio. Again, poor workman though
Wentworth was, the tools to his hand were not good.
He himself had only with great difficulty taught six
of his regiments the rudiments of discipline in the
Isle of Wight. His regimental officers were, without
exception, young and inexperienced, while some few of
them, who had obtained commissions through political
jobbery, are described as the most abandoned wretches
of the town. The American troops, which formed a
third of the whole force, were incomparably worse than
the worst of the English, and being made up to some
extent of Irish papists were more than a little untrustworthy.
Again, although the least foresight must have
shown that the brunt of the work would fall upon the
artillery, the gunners furnished to Wentworth were
raw yokels, just caught up from the plough and wholly
ignorant of their duty, while their commander was
incapable, and his second a drunkard. Of the engineers
it is sufficient to repeat that after the chief was killed
not one could be found with the slightest knowledge
of his duty. Moreover, of the eight battering cannon
furnished to him one was found to be unserviceable and
the rest were all of different patterns, while the shells,
like the hand-grenades, were of bad quality. Again,
the stores of all kinds were so unspeakably bad as to call
forth the bitterest complaints from Wentworth; and
beyond all doubt bad food contributed to increase the
sickliness of the Army and to weaken the men against
the attacks of yellow fever. In fact, the trail of the
incompetent Newcastle is over the whole expedition;
but these blunders and deficiencies only the less excuse
Wentworth for failing to adopt a swifter and more
dashing system of operations.</p>

</div>

<p>Vernon, on his side, boasted loudly that had he been
invested with the sole command he would have accomplished
every object at a far lower sacrifice of life;
and it is probable that he spoke truth. Certainly he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
never ceased to impress upon Wentworth the necessity
for bold and active measures. Nevertheless it was
Vernon who was mainly responsible for the fatal friction
between army and navy. He seems to have been by
nature a bully; imperious, conceited, insolent, and
without an idea of tact. The ill-feeling between the
two services had shown itself before the expedition
joined Vernon's fleet at Jamaica; and the Thirty-fourth
regiment, which had been detailed for service on the
men-of-war, lost half of its numbers through ill-usage
on board ship before a shot was fired. It would have
been a sufficiently difficult task for Vernon to have
composed these differences, but far from attempting it
he set himself deliberately to aggravate them. Still,
when the whole history of the expedition is examined
the blame for its failure must rest not with the General,
not with the Admiral, not even with the Government,
but with those benighted and unscrupulous politicians
who gambled away the efficiency of the Army and of
the military administration for the petty triumphs of
party and the petty emoluments of place and power.</p>

<p class="noindent">Long before the enterprise against the Spanish Main
had worn itself out to its tragical end, all Europe had
been kindled into a blaze of war. On the 20th of
October 1740, while Cathcart was still impatiently
awaiting the fair wind which should carry him from
Spithead, the Emperor Charles the Sixth died, leaving
his daughter Maria Theresa sole heiress of his dominions.
Her succession had already been recognised by the
powers of Europe through their guarantee of the
Pragmatic Sanction, but on such guarantees little trust
was to be reposed. The principal rival to the Queen
of Hungary was the Elector of Bavaria, and France,
mindful of her old friendship with Bavaria, was ready
enough to wreak her old hostility upon the House of
Austria by upholding him. England and Holland
alone, commercial nations to whom a contract was a
thing not lightly to be broken, felt strongly as to their
duty in supporting the young Queen. The various
states of Germany were as usual self-seeking and disunited,
watching greedily to make what profit they
could out of the helpless House of Hapsburg. Frederick
of Prussia, not yet named the Great, was the first to
move. He had but recently come to the throne, inheriting
together with it the most efficient army in
Europe, and a large stock of ready money. Moving,
as ever, promptly, swiftly, and silently, he invaded
Silesia, and by a signal victory over the Austrians at
Mollwitz called the whole of Europe to arms.</p>

<p>France, with visions not only of acquiring new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
territory in Germany, but of paying off old scores
against England through Hanover, had begun to weave
great schemes even before the fight of Mollwitz. The
most remarkable of living French statesmen, Marshal
Belleisle, having thought out his plans and obtained the
royal sanction for them, started off in March 1741 on
a tour of visits to the courts of Europe; his object
being to persuade them, first to renounce the Pragmatic
Sanction, and secondly to support the candidature of
the Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria against that of
Maria Theresa's husband, the Grand Duke Francis of
Lorraine, for the imperial crown. This done, he seems
to have hoped to partition Austria proper between Saxony
and Prussia, and to divide all Germany and the Empire
into four weak kingdoms, Bavaria, Saxony, Prussia, and
Hungary, which by careful fostering of jealousies and
quarrels should be kept dependent on France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">

1742.<br />February.</div>

<p>Charles Albert of Bavaria, Augustus of Saxony,
Frederick of Prussia and the Queen of Spain were
gained over by Belleisle with little difficulty; but
Hanover, with England at its back, stood out for the
Pragmatic Sanction. In England the sympathy with
Maria Theresa was strong, and Walpole in the session
of 1741 obtained from Parliament a pledge to maintain
her succession, a subsidy of three hundred thousand
pounds to tide her over financial difficulties, and an
acknowledgment of England's obligation to assist her
with a force of twelve thousand men. He also attempted
to detach Frederick from Belleisle's confederacy,
but with conspicuous ill-success. Meanwhile King
George went over to Hanover to assemble troops for
the support of Maria Theresa; and then France, always
ready to strike the first blow, sent two armies across the
Rhine, one to join hands with the forces of Bavaria and
carry the war to the gates of Vienna, the other straight
upon Hanover itself. Thus surprised, the King could
do nothing but stipulate for one year's neutrality for
Hanover, promising also that during the same period
he would neither give help to the Queen of Hungary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
nor cast his vote as an Elector of the Empire in her
husband's favour. Bound by this humiliating agreement,
which had excited no less scorn in England than
in Austria, the King returned home to meet a new
parliament, which had been elected amid no ordinary
excitement owing to the disasters on the Spanish Main.
Furious attacks were made upon Walpole, who was held
responsible for a war which he had always deprecated,
and for which he knew the nation to be unprepared;
and in less than two months he was driven from office.
Lord Wilmington succeeded him as nominal head of the
Treasury, and Lord Carteret, one of the few living
Englishmen who could speak German, took charge of
foreign affairs. Parliament showed itself more zealous
than ever in the cause of Maria Theresa, and voted her
a subsidy of half a million, while Carteret prevailed with
his colleagues to send sixteen thousand British troops to
Flanders to act as her auxiliaries in arms. Finally, five
millions were granted for the prosecution of the war.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that all these preparations could
be aimed at no power but France, the two nations were
not supposed to be at war with each other. The
French had invented the phrase auxiliaries, and had
marched their armies into Germany under the shelter
of that innocent designation; and the English were
foolish enough for a time to follow their example.
The movements of the French fleet at the outset of
Wentworth's expedition had, however, left little doubt
as to the hostility of France towards England, and the
fact had been settled beyond all dispute by some French
despatches intercepted by Vernon. The past year
therefore had not passed without additional military
preparations on the part of England. In January 1741
four more regiments of marines were raised over and
above those sent out with Wentworth; and simultaneously
orders were issued for the formation of seven
new regiments of foot under Colonels Fowke, Long,
Houghton, Price, Cholmondeley, and De Grangue. Of
these the first six still remain with us, numbered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Forty-third to the Forty-eighth. Throughout the
summer also a force of some five thousand men had
been kept in camp near Colchester under General
Wade, in readiness to take the field. Finally, the
estimates for 1742 provided for a force on the British
establishment of sixty-two thousand men. Sufficient
troops being therefore presumably to hand, the next
thing was to appoint a commander, and the choice fell
on John, Earl of Stair.</p>

<p>Stair was now close on seventy years of age, but
despite a very early beginning of a soldier's life, was
still active and efficient enough. At the age of nineteen
he had fought at Steenkirk, already with the rank
of colonel; in Marlborough's first campaign he had
been the foremost in the breach in Cutts's mad assault
upon Venloo; he had served as a regimental officer
at Blenheim, as a brigadier at Ramillies, on Marlborough's
staff at Oudenarde, and had been present also
at Malplaquet. He had been distinguished by particular
kindness and attention both from the great Duke and
from Prince Eugene, and had not failed to take to heart
their teaching in the art of war. Altogether he was not
ill-qualified to command a British army in its first
active service on the continent since the death of Marlborough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
May <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">6</span>
  <span class="blka over">17</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>His first duties, however, were diplomatic, namely
to induce the States-General to permit the occupation
of Nieuport and Ostend by the British, as their bases of
operations against the French in the Austrian Netherlands.
He was further instructed to allay any feeling
of distrust that might have been roused by Hanover's
declaration of neutrality, and if possible to engage the
Dutch to take an active part as auxiliaries of Queen
Maria Theresa. It was no easy task, for endless faction
joined to an impossible form of government had reduced
the Dutch to the lethargy, inefficiency, and
helplessness which was their ruin; while, moreover,
recollections of the Peace of Utrecht were still strong
enough to make them diffident and cold towards any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
overtures from England. The proposal to quarter a
British garrison in the Netherlands was therefore ill-received,
until, in the nick of time, there came the news
that the Austrians, having made a desperate push to
expel Frederick of Prussia from Silesia, had been totally
defeated by him at the battle of Chotusitz. Such a
blow to the Austrian cause might bring about great
results. Marshal Maillebois, with a French army of
forty thousand men, lay in Westphalia, blocking the
march of the Hanoverian troops if they should try to
join the British, and at the same time ready to pierce
into Holland at any moment. In such circumstances
a contingent of British troops could not but be valuable
to the States, so leave was granted for the disembarkation
of the first British battalions at Ostend; and
arrangements were made, though with no very good
grace, to find them quarters in Bruges and Ghent. But
as to throwing in their lot with the British for the
defence of the Pragmatic Sanction, the machinery of
the Dutch Government was too complicated, the minds
of men too cautious, and the spirit of those in authority
too corrupt, to permit the settlement of a matter of
such importance without delay of months or even years.</p>

<p>The British troops continued to arrive in driblets
from England, and Stair meanwhile, knowing that his
movements must depend upon those of the French,
watched the situation with the keenest interest. The
French army of Bavaria, after a few trifling successes
on the Danube, had been rapidly swept back by the
energy of the Austrian General Khevenhüller. A
portion of it, which had penetrated into Bohemia and
captured Prague, was still lying in that kingdom under
an incompetent commander, Marshal Broglie, with
Prague for its base. Little was to be feared from
Broglie: the really formidable enemy was Frederick of
Prussia, whom Stair was for detaching from Belleisle's
confederacy at any cost. The Prussian army once out
of the way, the whole armed force of Austria could
be turned upon the French in Bohemia, who, owing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Khevenhüller's successes on the Danube, must either be
sacrificed altogether, or rescued with great difficulty at
the price of denuding the whole French frontier of
troops. It would then be open to the Austrians to
advance through the Palatinate and up the Moselle into
France, while the Dutch and English might either join
them or break straight in from the north upon Paris
and put an end to the war and to the mischief of French
ambition for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">May 31</span>
  <span class="blka over">June 11.</span>
</span></div>

<p>So counselled Stair, with a clearness of judgment,
alike as soldier and statesman, that was not unworthy
of his great master; but unfortunately Maria Theresa
would not come to terms with Frederick without
striking a last blow for Silesia, which ended, as has been
told, in the disaster of Chotusitz. Then at last she
gave in; and the Treaty of Breslau purchased the friendship
of Frederick at the cost of Silesia. Stair was
instantly on the alert, for the game seemed now to be
in his hand. The French frontier towards the Netherlands
was but weakly defended; a feint of invasion in
that direction must certainly bring back Maillebois from
Westphalia to guard it, and then the road would be
open for the junction of the Hanoverians with the
British. The Austrians had already fourteen thousand
troops in the country, which, added to the British and
their Allies, would make up a force superior to any
that Maillebois could bring together.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Carteret entered
warmly into the plan; and meanwhile events elsewhere
had fallen out exactly according to Stair's prevision.
The Austrians, relieved from the pressure of Frederick
and his Prussians, turned all their strength against the
French in Bohemia, and swept them out of all their
posts except Prague, wherein they held the wreck of
the French force closely besieged. Maillebois was called
away to Bohemia to save the beleaguered army if he
could, and the whole of the French frontier towards
Flanders lay open, with little more than twenty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
men to protect it. This was the moment for which
Stair had waited, hardly daring to hope that it would
ever come, and he urged that the whole of the forces
present, alike of England, Hanover, and Austria, should
be concentrated for an immediate attack on Dunkirk,
where the best of the French troops were known to be
gathered together. These troops once beaten, the road
would be clear for a march to Paris.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>But just at this moment King George suddenly
turned lukewarm. He was not at war with France, he
said, and his troops were acting simply as auxiliaries to
the Queen of Hungary. France could take no offence
at their presence, as her troops were likewise employed
only as auxiliaries to the Elector of Bavaria.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Again,
there were sundry arrangements to be adjusted before
the troops of the Allies could be concentrated. It was,
therefore, not until the 24th of August that orders were
despatched to the Hanoverians to march; and even
then King George was inclined rather to bar the return
march of Maillebois from Bohemia at the Meuse than
to strike at the heart of his enemy at Dunkirk. Then,
again, the men of skill in England, as Stair contemptuously
called the council of war at Whitehall, thought
the attack on Dunkirk too venturesome; and the plan
was disapproved, chiefly, it should seem, because the
King had some idea of taking command of the Army in
person.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Stair meanwhile was chafing with impatience,
concerting new plans with the Austrian commanders,
and promising himself that his winter quarters should
be in Normandy. His design now was to march
straight for the head of the Oise, which would give him
a navigable river for his transport, and to move from
thence direct upon Paris. The French troops on the
spot were few in number and would not dare to leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Dunkirk. The road for two-thirds of the journey to
the Oise was paved, and the short distance that remained,
therefore, constituted the only difficulty, by no
means insuperable, in the way. Arrived at Paris the
army could take artillery from the arsenal there, and
move down the Seine to the siege of Havre. Finally,
Stair promised that, if the King would give him a free
hand, he would enable him before the 12th of October
to dictate his own terms.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>The plan was daring enough, but Stair was neither
a visionary nor an idle boaster, and there appears no
reason to doubt that it was perfectly feasible. The
French had recently fortified Dunkirk anew, and, as
was not uncommon with them, had elaborated the works
to such excess that forty thousand men were required to
defend them. Unless, therefore, they chose to abandon
Dunkirk, which they could hardly afford to do, there
remained no troops to check an advance on Paris. But
the design did not commend itself to the King. He
submitted it to General Wade, slowest and most cautious
of generals, who criticised it adversely; and meanwhile,
whether through jealousy or treachery or sheer mismanagement,
the orders for the Hanoverians to march
were on one pretext or another delayed until all hopes
of a campaign of 1742 were banished by the coming of
the winter.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1743.<br />February.</div>

<p>Stair was deeply chagrined; and the discipline of
his troops, who had been long kept idle in quarters
which they detested, suffered so much that it was only
restored by the strongest measures.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The winter set in
with unusual severity, making the ground easy for
purposes of transport and neutralising the value of the
inundations on which the fortresses of the north-west
frontier of France depended chiefly for their defence.
Stair was eager to pounce upon some of them while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>frost lasted, but the Austrian generals would not hear
of it. He then proposed to attack one or other of the
fortresses in Lorraine, Metz, Longwy, or Thionville,
preparatory to an invasion of France by the Moselle;
but again the Austrians dissented.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Their great object
was to move King George's army into Germany, in
order to frighten some of the minor German princes into
alliance with Austria; and Stair, as he bitterly complained,
was so much hampered by his instructions that
he felt absolutely helpless.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The Hanoverians again,
though supposed to be under his command, received
independent orders from the King which were not
communicated to Stair, and they declined to obey any
other.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> At last, after many struggles with Austrian
generals and English ministers, the British army in
February 1743 began its march eastward, as the
Austrians had desired. The regiments were sadly
distressed by the absence of multitudes of officers, who
had gone home on leave for their duties in Parliament
or for more private and trivial objects. "I thought it
hard to refuse them leave," wrote Stair with biting
sarcasm, "when they said that their preferment depended
on the interest of their friends at Court. They had no
notion that it depended on their exertions here."<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> To
such a pass had twenty years of peace under Walpole
brought the discipline of the Army.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Stair's recent severity had borne good
fruit, and the conduct both of officers and men in a
winter's march of extreme hardship and discomfort
was such as to call forth his warmest praise.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> As
the spring drew near, the question as to the plan of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>the coming campaign became urgent. Fifty thousand
French troops had been moved to the Moselle to bar
any invasion through Lorraine, while all their forces in
Flanders had been stationed on the Meuse ready either
to join their comrades on the Moselle, or to advance to
the Neckar in case the Allies should cross the Rhine
to the south of Cologne. Stair, with the spirit of his
master strong upon him, hinted at the desirability of
a march to the Danube. The Austrians, as he guessed,
would certainly resume their advance from the east
against the French on that river as soon as the weather
permitted, and his plan was to close in upon them from
the west and fall upon their rear while the Austrians
attacked them in front. Such a project, however, was
too bold for the caution of King George, and, moreover,
as he was always reminding Stair, though the French
were to be treated as enemies he was not at war with
France.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> His final orders, given after immense delay,
were that Stair should occupy the heights of Mainz and
command the junction of the Rhine and Main.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Such a
disposition was from a military point of view sufficiently
obscure; and indeed it had no military object whatever,
being designed simply to secure the choice of King
George's nominee for the vacant electorate of Mainz.</p>

<p>Very slowly, owing to the extreme difficulty of
obtaining forage, the forces, both native and mercenary,
of England, Hanover, and Austria were assembled on
the north bank of the Main. Their position extended
from the Rhine to Aschaffenburg, and faced to the
south, while a bridge of boats was kept ready at Frankfort
for the passage of the river.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Meanwhile, a French
army of seventy thousand men, under Marshal Noailles,
had quietly taken up its station on the Upper Rhine
near Spires, and was seeking to establish communication
with Bavaria and the Neckar, in order to save what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>was left of Broglie's army while still it might; though,
at the same time, not without apprehensions as to the
danger of leaving the Palatinate and Lorraine open
behind it. Stair took in the situation at a glance. He
was for crossing the Main, following the left bank
downward and taking up a position between Oppenheim
and Mainz. There he could threaten Noailles so
closely that he would not dare to detach any part of
his army to Bavaria. He would, moreover, have it
in his power to attack the French on the Neckar whenever
he pleased; and finally, he could in due time
cross the Rhine westward, and force the French to
retire on Landau and Alsace, leaving Lorraine and
the Netherlands open to invasion. After some trouble
Count d'Arenberg, a general neither very enterprising
nor very capable, who commanded the Austrians, appears
to have been converted to his views; and though the
entire army was even now not yet arrived at the
rendezvous, the Allies on the 3rd of June began the
passage of the Main. A day or two later Stair received
intelligence that Noailles had left the Neckar and was
advancing along the high road from Darmstadt to
Frankfort to attack him. This road passed for a
considerable distance through a forest, and it was at
its outlet from this forest that Stair took up his position
to await the French. D'Arenberg so strongly disapproved
of the whole proceeding that he withdrew
the whole of the Austrian dragoons to the right bank
of the Main, in order to rescue the shattered remnants
that should be left of Stair's army after the battle.
Marshal Neipperg, his second, however, led the Austrian
infantry to the position of Stair's choice: and when
Noailles arrived on the following morning he withdrew
without venturing to attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">May 30</span>
  <span class="blka over">June 10.</span>
</span></div>

<p>Meanwhile King George, who had arrived at
Hanover a fortnight before, was perfectly frantic. On
Stair's first proposal to cross to the south bank of the
Main he had sent positive orders, which reached Stair
too late, that he was not to stir. The King was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
surrounded by nervous Austrians who, having information
of Noailles's intended advance, were, or professed
to be, in terror lest the Allies should be beaten in
detail, and did not fail to represent how dreadful it
would be if the army should be defeated before His
Majesty could take command. Letter after letter
therefore was despatched to Stair, bidding him above
all things to be careful, and finally ordering him to
repass the Main. Stair at first had prepared to obey
orders, though not without speaking his mind. "I
am too careful of the King's interest," he wrote, "to
be rash, but I am sure of two things, that the French
are far more occupied with Bavaria than with us, and
that we are superior to them even in numbers. The
importance of giving an army to a person who is trusted
is now evident. Had my plan been followed, we should
now be in a position to fall on the head of the French
army which, after sending away a detachment to
Bavaria, is now taking post along the Rhine." In
truth, during the months of May and June, the Austrians
on the Danube had swept Broglie right out of Germany;
and Noailles's detachment no sooner reached him than
it was ordered forthwith to retreat. But when Stair
heard of Noailles's advance to attack him he quietly
suppressed the King's orders to repass the Main until
he had offered battle to the French. When Noailles
refused it, Stair recrossed the river as he had been
bidden, unwillingly indeed, yet not a little satisfied that
after all the King's orders and all the Austrian predictions
of disaster, he had successfully proved the soundness
of his views. "But," he added significantly on
arriving on the northern bank, "it will be impossible for
us now to find forage. The French being masters of one
side of the river, forage cannot be brought down to us
by water, so we must move upward." It was just this
question of supplies which had made him so anxious for a
general action; and the event proved that he was right.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th of June King George at last arrived
from Hanover and took over the command of the
army, which was encamped, as he had ordered, on the
right bank of the Main, the English and Hanoverians
lying about Aschaffenburg. In the hope of securing
forage on the other bank, a battery had been erected on
the bridge of Aschaffenburg, but Noailles, moving up to
the river, erected a redoubt at his own end of the
bridge and put an end to all such hopes. Meanwhile he
seized a post further up the river to intercept all supplies
from Franconia, and threw two bridges over it below
Aschaffenburg at Seligenstadt, by which his troops
could cross and cut off the Allies from their magazines
at Hanau. For a week the King remained helpless
in this camp, unwilling to retreat though his peril
increased every day. The result was that he found
himself in command of a starving army. It was
impossible to keep the soldiers from plunder, and
discipline became seriously relaxed. At last, on the
26th of June, it was perforce resolved that the army
must retreat to Hanau that very night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
June <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">16</span>
  <span class="blka over">27</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Noailles had not been idle. The ground
on which the Allies were encamped is a narrow plain
pent in between the Spessart Hills and the Main. These
hills are densely wooded, and the forest appears at
that time to have descended lower into the plain than
at present. When therefore the Allies retired to Hanau,
as Noailles knew that inevitably they must, it would
be impossible for them to keep out of range of cannon
posted on the opposite bank of the Main, and accordingly
the marshal had erected five different batteries to play
upon them during their march. At one o'clock on
the morning of the 27th intelligence was brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
him that the Allies were in motion. This was the
moment for which he had been waiting. Instantly
galloping to Seligenstadt, he ordered Count Grammont to
cross the Main with twenty-eight thousand men by the
two bridges which he had laid for the purpose, and to
take up a position about a mile up the river by the
village of Dettingen. At that point a rivulet runs
down across the plain from the Spessart Hills to the
Main, through a little boggy dale which was uncrossed
by any bridge except by that of the high road to
Hanau. There Grammont was bidden to wait and to
make an end of the Allies as they defiled over the
bridge. He took up his position accordingly, and
Noailles returned to the opposite bank of the Main to
direct his operations against King George's flank and rear.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock in the morning before the Allied
army was fairly in motion. The British cavalry led the
way, followed by the Austrian, then came the British
infantry and the Austrian infantry after them; and last
of all came a strong rear-guard composed of the British
Guards, the choicest of the German infantry, and the
Hanoverian cavalry; for it was in the rear that an
attack of the French was most looked for and most to
be dreaded. The apprehensions of a French advance on
Aschaffenburg were soon seen to be well founded. The
march of the Allies from that town lay across a bend of
the Main to the village of Klein Ostheim, and as they
approached the river they could see the French on the
opposite bank in full march to cross the river behind
them and cut off their retreat up the stream. Thus
Noailles's dispositions were complete. These troops
were to block the Allies to the south, impenetrable
woods shut them off from the east, the Main barred
their way on the west, and Grammont stood before
them at Dettingen on the north. Noailles had caught
them, as he said, in a mouse-trap, and might reasonably
feel certain that they could not escape.</p>

<p>On arriving about seven o'clock at Klein Ostheim,
the whole army of the Allies was obliged to file through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
it by a single road. The cavalry, therefore, when it
had passed through the village was halted and wheeled
round with its face to the river to wait till the infantry
should come up. This again Noailles had foreseen, and
he had planted his cannon in exactly the right place to
play upon the Allies when they should advance beyond
the village. For an hour the cavalry stood halted before
the march could be resumed; and now came intelligence
from an advanced party in Dettingen that Grammont
was in order of battle in front and that an immediate
engagement was inevitable. King George hastened to
set his army likewise in order of battle; but all the
baggage had been massed between the first and second
divisions of the column of route, and the confusion for
a time was very great. Meanwhile the French troops
bound for Aschaffenburg had by this time cleared the
front of the first of Noailles's batteries and left the guns
free to open fire. The shot soon came humming thick
and fast into the heavy mass of waggons and baggage-animals,
and the confusion increased. Guns were sent
for in frantic haste to silence the French cannon, but
the artillery being far in the rear was long in making
its appearance: and meanwhile the King capered about
on horseback in great excitement, staff-officers galloped
to and fro, and the troops marched and counter-marched
into their positions, always under the deadly fire of the
French battery. Gradually, though with infinite difficulty,
the troops were shuffled into their places, for the
stereotyped order of battle was useless in a plain that
permitted a frontage only of twenty-three battalions and
a few squadrons at most. So passed a terrible hour
and more, until at last the British guns came into
action and replied effectively to the French batteries;
and then a push was made to shift the baggage into a
place of safety. In the middle of the plain between
Klein Ostheim and Dettingen stood a wood flanked on
each hand by a morass. Two lines of cavalry were
moved forward towards this wood, the baggage followed
them, the infantry followed the baggage, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
troublesome waggons were at last stowed away securely
under cover of the trees, while the cavalry and the
Austrian infantry made haste to form the right of the
Allies' line of battle.</p>

<p>It was high time, for it was now almost noon, and
Grammont, tired of remaining where he had been bidden
to wait on the north side of Dettingen, or believing (as
he himself said) that the Allies had already passed him
and that only their rear-guard was left, had advanced
beyond the ravine to take up a fresh position. So far
as the Allies could see, he was manœuvring to move
troops down under cover of the forest upon their right
flank. By this time, however, King George's line was
formed, and on its extreme left were seen the scarlet coats
of the British battalions. To the left of all, and within
a furlong of the river, stood the Thirty-third Foot, and
to its right in succession the Twenty-first Fusiliers,
Twenty-third Fusiliers, Twelfth, Eleventh, Eighth and
Thirteenth Foot. On the right of the Thirteenth stood
an Austrian brigade, and then in succession the Blues,
Life Guards, Sixth Dragoons, and Royal Dragoons.
All of these were in the first line. In the second line,
in rear of their comrades on the left, were posted the
Twentieth, Thirty-second, Thirty-seventh, Thirty-first,
and the Buffs; and in rear of the cavalry on the right,
the Seventh Dragoon Guards, King's Dragoon Guards,
Fourth and Seventh Dragoons, and the Scots Greys.
Opposite to them the French were ranged in two lines
with a reserve in third line, the infantry being in the
centre and the cavalry on the flanks, so that the famous
French Household Cavalry,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> in its place of honour on
the extreme right, stood opposed to the British battalions
on the Allied left. General Clayton, who commanded
on the left, observing the mass of cavalry that confronted
him, sent hastily for the Third Dragoons to fill
up the gap between the Thirty-third and the river, and
therewith the British dispositions were complete.</p>

<p>The whole of the first line then advanced, the King,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
who had with difficulty been prevented from stationing
himself on the extreme left, waving his sword and
shouting words of encouragement with a broad German
accent. Fortunately the French were themselves in
great disorder and confusion. The corrupt dealing in
the appointment and promotion of officers, which fifty
years later was to set the French army on the side of
the Revolution, was already undermining efficiency and
discipline. Grammont on advancing beyond the ravine
had thought out no new order of a battle. Not a
brigadier was competent to draw up his brigade, and
the Household Cavalry kept manœuvring about in
front of the infantry without a thought except for the
fine figure that it was cutting in the sight of both armies.
The advance of the Allies was necessarily slow, for some
of the English regiments, whose way lay through the
morasses, were knee-deep in mire. The whole line was
presently halted to take breath, and the British, evidently
a little shaken by the previous hurry and confusion
and by the gesticulations of the King, broke into a
feeble and irregular cheer, a sound which Lord Stair
heard with great displeasure. The line was dressed
and the advance was resumed in better order, though
the French batteries on the other bank of the Main never
ceased to rain destruction on the Third Dragoons and
on the unfortunate battalions on the left. The men
were not yet quite steady, for some undisciplined spirits,
fretting at the incessant parade of the French Household
Cavalry, opened an irregular fire all along the line.
Then, as it seems, came the most comical incident of the
day. King George's horse, frightened by the crackle
of the musketry, took the bit in his teeth and bolted
away to the rear, His Majesty, with purple face and eyes
starting out of his head, pulling desperately at him with
both hands but unable to stop him. Ultimately the
animal's career was checked, and the King returning to
the right of the line dismounted and resumed his gestures
on foot, utterly fearless, as are all of his race, and
confident that his own legs, at least, would carry him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in the right direction. The line was again halted to
load, there being fortunately still time to repair previous
faults, and the advance was again resumed with greater
steadiness.</p>

<p>Then the French infantry of the Guard on Grammont's
right centre advanced likewise, cheering loudly,
and opened a fitful and disorderly fire. The British,
now thoroughly in hand, answered with a regular, swift,
and continuous fire of platoons, the ranks standing firm
like a wall of brass and pouring in volley after volley,
deadly and unceasing&mdash;such a fire as no French officer
had ever seen before.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The French Guards staggered
under it and the British again raised an irregular cheer.
"Silence," shouted Stair imperiously, galloping up.
"Now one and all together when I give the signal."
And as he raised his hat the British broke into the stern
and appalling shout which was to become so famous on
the fields of the Peninsula. The French Guards waited
for no more when they heard it, but shrank back in
disorder in rear of their horse, which now advanced in
earnest against the extreme British left.</p>

<p>Clayton saw the danger. His left flank in the
general confusion had never been properly secured, and
though the fire of the French batteries by the river had
ceased lest it should destroy their own troops, yet the
Third Dragoons and the Thirty-third had been much
weakened by it during their advance. Despatching
urgent messages for reinforcements of cavalry, he put a
bold face on the matter, ordered the Dragoons, Thirty-third,
Twenty-first, and Twenty-third forward to meet
the French attack, and prepared to stand the shock.
Down came the flower of the French cavalry upon
them, sword in hand, at high speed. The Third
Dragoons were the first to close with them. They
were but two weak squadrons against nine squadrons of
the enemy, their depth was but of three ranks against
eight ranks of the French; but they went straight at
them, burst into the heart of them and cut their way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
through, though with heavy loss. The Thirty-third
faced the attack as boldly, never gave way for an inch
and brought men and horses crashing down by their
eternal rolling fire. Next to them the two regiments
of Fusiliers were even more hardly pressed. The
Gendarmerie came down upon them at full trot with
pistols in both hands and swords dangling by the wrist.
Arrived within range they fired the pistols, dashed the
empty weapons in the faces of the British, and then fell
in with the sword; but the Fusiliers, as it was said,
fought like devils, their platoon-fire thundering out as
regularly as on parade, and the French horse fell back
repulsed.</p>

<p>Still, gallantly as this first attack had been met, the
numerical superiority of the French cavalry was formidable,
and there was imminent danger lest the British
left flank should be turned. The Third Dragoons
had suffered heavily, after their first charge, from the
bullets of a battalion posted in support of the French
horse, but they rallied, and twice more, weak and weary
as they were, they charged ten times their numbers and
cut their way through them. But after the third charge
they were well-nigh annihilated. All the officers except
two, and three-fourths of the men and horses had been
killed or wounded; two of the three standards had
been cut to atoms, both silk and staves, by shot and
shell, and in the last charge the third had dropped from
a cornet's wounded hand and lay abandoned on the
ground. A trooper of the regiment, Thomas Brown
by name, was just dismounting to recover it when a
French sabre came down on his bridle-hand and shore
away two of his fingers. His horse, missing the familiar
pressure of the bit, at once bolted, and before he could
be pulled up had carried his rider into the rear of the
French lines. There Dragoon Brown saw the standard
of his regiment borne away in triumph by a French
gendarme. Disabled as he was he rode straight at the
Frenchman, attacked and killed him; and then gripping
the standard between his leg and the saddle he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and fought his way single-handed through the ranks of
the enemy, emerging at last with three bullet-holes
through his hat and seven wounds in his face and body,
but with the standard safe.</p>

<p>But now the First and Seventh Dragoons, which
had been summoned from the right, came galloping up
and fell in gallantly enough upon the French Household
Cavalry. These were, however, repulsed, partly,
it should seem, because they attacked with more impetuosity
than order, partly because the French were
armed with helmets and breastplates heavy enough to
turn a pistol shot. The Blues followed close after
them, but sacrificing order to speed were, like their
comrades, driven back in confusion; and the French
Gendarmes, flushed with success, bore down for the
second time upon the Twenty-first and Twenty-third
and succeeded in breaking into them. But the two
battalions were broken only for a moment. Quickly
recovering themselves they faced inwards, and closing
in upon the French in their midst shot them down by
scores. The Fourth and Sixth British Dragoons, together
with two regiments of Austrian dragoons, now
came up and renewed the combat against the French
Household Cavalry, but it was not until after they had
been twice repulsed that at last they succeeded, with the
help of their rallied comrades, in forcing back the
intrepid squadrons of the French horse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the battle elsewhere had flagged. A
feeble attack of the French against the right of the
Allies had been easily repelled, and in the centre the
second line of the French infantry had cared little more
than the first to face the terrible English fire. But
while the Gendarmerie were still pressing the British
hard on the left, the French Black Musketeers suddenly
broke away from their place by their side, and wheeling
to their left galloped madly between the fire of friendly
and hostile infantry to make a dash upon the British
Royal Dragoons at the extreme right of the Allied line.
The Austrian Marshal Neipperg no sooner saw them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
than he exclaimed: "Now is the time. The British
horse will attack in front, and our horse in flank, and
the thing is done." British and Austrians at once
closed in upon the Black Musketeers, cut them to
pieces, and then bore down upon the flank of the French
infantry. The French foot, which had behaved very
unworthily of itself all day, now took to its heels and
fled in confusion towards the Main. The British horse
on the left, one regiment in particular burning to wipe
out the humiliation of its first failure, pressed the French
Household Cavalry harder than ever in front, and the
Scots Greys plunging in upon their flank threw them
into utter rout. The whole French army now made
headlong for the fords and bridges of the Main, the
infantry in their panic plunging madly into the stream
and perishing by scores if not by hundreds in the water.
Now was the moment for a vigorous pursuit, and had
Stair been left to work his own will the French would
have suffered very heavily; but the King was too
thankful to have escaped from Noailles's mousetrap to
think of turning his good fortune to account. The
Marshal was allowed to retreat in peace, and thus, after
four hours of sharp work, ended the battle of Dettingen.</p>

<p>Seldom has a commander found more fortunate
issue from a series of blunders than King George. Had
Grammont obeyed his orders it is difficult to see how
a man of the Allied Army could have escaped; but even
allowing for Grammont's ill-timed impatience it is
strange that Noailles should have allowed the day to go
as it went. It is true that he had sent the best of his
troops across the Main with Grammont, but he had
still from twenty to thirty thousand men on his own
side of the river whom he left standing idle, without an
attempt to employ them. He seems, in fact, to have
been paralysed with dismay over the wreck of his very
skilful combinations. The action itself deserves the
name of a combat rather than a battle, for on neither
side was more than half of the force really engaged;
yet Dettingen was decidedly a victory, for the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
were badly beaten and lost little, if any, less than five
thousand men, killed, wounded, and prisoners. The
loss of the Allies was about half of that number, of
which the British share was two hundred and sixty-five
killed and five hundred and sixty-one wounded, the
most valuable life taken being that of General Clayton.
As the brunt of the action fell wholly on the first line,
the greatest sufferers among the infantry were the
regiments chiefly exposed to the flanking fire of the
French batteries. These were the Thirty-third, Twenty-first,
Twenty-third, and Twelfth of the Line, but in not
one of them did the casualties exceed one hundred men,
or about an eighth of their strength. The cavalry
suffered far more heavily in comparison, though here
again the losses of the heroes of the day, the Third
Dragoons, were more than twice as great as those of
any other regiment: one hundred and fifty men and as
many horses forming a terrible proportion of casualties
in two squadrons. The most noticeable points in the
engagement were the disgraceful behaviour of the French
infantry, by no one more severely censured than by
Noailles himself, and the deadly accuracy of the British
fire. A smaller but curious fact is that both the King
and the Duke of Cumberland were run away with by
their horses, the former, as has been told, to the rear,
the latter to the front, and indeed into the midst of the
French infantry, from which, however, he emerged with
no greater hurt than a bullet in the leg. At the close
of the day the King was so much elated by his success
as to revive the creation of knights banneret in the field,
a proceeding which ceases to seem ridiculous when we
learn that Lord Stair was the first and Dragoon Thomas
Brown the last of the new knights. Such a scene was
never to be seen again, for Dettingen was the last action
in which a king of England actually commanded his
army in person.</p>

<p>The ceremony of knighthood completed, the King
left his wounded on the ground to the care of Noailles,
and hastened away as quickly as possible with the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to his magazine at Hanau. The battle virtually closed
the campaign, so far as the British were concerned, and
King George returned home with his laurels fresh upon
him, to be hailed with acclamation as a victor, and hear
his praises sung in endless stanzas of most execrable
verse. A few months later Lord Stair also returned
home, without recrimination and without complaint,
but with resolute and scornful determination to resign
the command, since he was not trusted with the conduct
of operations. General Wade was appointed field-marshal,
to command in his stead. Finally, some weeks
later the ridiculous fiction, that the principal combatants
were acting only as auxiliaries to rival claimants to the
Empire, was abandoned, and open war was declared
against France. Had this straightforward course been
adopted two years before, Stair would probably have
turned the date of the declaration of war into that
of the conclusion of an honourable peace. As matters
stood the war was prolonged, and the time of its avowed
inception was chosen as the moment for discarding the
ablest of living British Generals.</p>

<p class="noindent">However fortunate might be the issue of Dettingen, it
served at least its purpose in preventing the despatch of
French reinforcements to the Danube and to Bohemia;
and the campaign of 1743 closed with the utter collapse
of Belleisle's great schemes and with the expulsion of
the French from Germany. It was now clear that the
war would be carried on in the familiar cockpit of the
Austrian Netherlands. Such a theatre was convenient
for France, since it lay close to her own borders, and
convenient for the Allies, because the Dutch had at last
been persuaded to join them, and because the British
would be brought nearer to their base at Ostend.
Marshal Saxe, whose fine talent had hitherto been
wasted under incompetent French Generals in Bohemia,
was appointed to the chief command of the French in
Flanders; and every effort was made to give him a
numerous and well-equipped army, and to enable him
to open his campaign in good time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744.</div>

<p>In England the preparations by no means corresponded
with the necessities of the position. The estimates
indeed provided for a force of twenty-one thousand
British in Flanders in 1744 as against sixteen thousand
in the previous year, but only at the cost of depleting
the weak garrison left in England; for the actual
number of men voted for the two years was the same.
All British officers of experience strongly urged upon the
Government the importance of being first in the field,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
but when an army was to be made up in different
proportions of English, Dutch, Germans, and Austrians
it needed a Marlborough to bring the discordant Courts
into harmony as well as to make ready the troops for
an early campaign. By the beginning of April eighty
thousand French soldiers had marched from their
winter quarters, and were concentrated on the frontier
between the Scheldt and the Sambre, while the Allies
were still scattered about in cantonments, not exceeding
even then a total strength of fifty-five thousand men.
Wade, the English commander, delayed first by confusion
at home and next by contrary winds, was still in
England while the French were concentrating, and not
a single English recruit to repair the losses of the past
campaign had arrived in Flanders. Then arose disputes
as to the disposition of the Allied forces, both Austrians
and Dutch being nervously apprehensive of leaving their
towns on the frontier without garrisons. When in the
second week in May the Allied Army was at last collected
close to Brussels, it was still weaker by twenty thousand
men than it should have been, and found itself confronted
with the task of holding Flanders, Brabant,
Hainault, and the Sambre against a superior force of
French.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> May passed away and June came, but the
Allies remained helpless and motionless in their camp,
while Saxe, after a short march westward, turned north
and advanced steadily between the Scheldt and the Lys.
His principal object was not very difficult to divine.
By the middle of June his detachments had seized
Ypres and Fort Knock, which commanded the canal
from Nieuport to Ypres, thus cutting off the British
from one of their bases on the coast. It remained to
be seen whether he would aim next at Ostend, where
the whole of the British stores of ordnance were accumulated,
or whether he would attempt Bruges and
Ghent in order to secure the navigation of the Bruges
Canal as well as of the Scheldt and Lys. Again, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
always open to him, if he pleased, to besiege Tournay,
a fortress which the Allies would not willingly lose.
Thus the problem set to the Allies was not easy of
solution; but of all solutions they chose the worst.
The Dutch and Austrians could not bear the notion
of forsaking any one of their darling strongholds,
and insisted that the strength of the army should
be frittered away in providing weak garrisons for
the defence of all.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Wade, to do him justice, was
for keeping all the troops together, crossing the Scheldt,
and taking up a strong position to cover Ghent;
but the Austrians would not consent lest they should
expose Brussels.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Wade was certainly not a strong
man, but he must not be too hardly judged. Marlborough
had spent the most anxious days of all
his campaigns in distraction between the safety of
Ghent and of Brussels, and had only extricated
himself by the march that preceded the battle of
Oudenarde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>Meanwhile King George had been exerting himself
with great energy, but two months too late, to provide
Wade with additional troops, both British and
Dutch, and had begged that Prince Charles of Lorraine
might cross the Rhine with his whole army, and
direct the operations in Flanders as Commander-in-Chief
of all the Allies. It was a wise step in every
way, since the Prince's relationship to Queen Maria
Theresa assured to him the seniority in rank which was
needed to hold so heterogeneous a host in coherence.
Prince Charles did his share of the work admirably,
forcing his passage across the Rhine with great
skill in the face of the French, and taking up
a strong position on the frontier of Alsace. A
few days later the British reinforcements reached
Wade, and King George issued positive orders to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>him to take the offensive and "commence hostilities
of all kinds."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">
July <span class="blkb">

</span>.</div>

<p>It seemed, indeed, as if the time were come for
pressing home upon the French; but just at this
critical moment Frederick of Prussia intervened in
favour of France, and by a threat to invade Bohemia
brought Prince Charles back quickly over the Rhine.
None the less Wade and his fellows held a council of
war and resolved to bring Saxe to action if possible.
King George gave his gracious approval to their plan,
and on the 31st of July the Allies turned westward
and crossed the Scheldt. It still remained to be seen,
however, whether Saxe would allow an action to be
forced on him; for he lay now, entrenched to the
teeth, on the Lys between Menin and Courtrai, which
was a pretty clear indication that he would not. At
this moment Lord Stair, who had followed the course
of operations carefully from England, came forward,
like a true pupil of Marlborough, with a new plan of
campaign. His advice was that the Allies should turn
Saxe's tactics against himself. They should march south
to Orchies, between Lille and Tournay, and there
encamp, where they would be within reach of half a
dozen French fortified towns. The French would not
dare to leave the fortresses defenceless; and the
garrisons necessary to render them secure would
absorb the whole of their force in the field. Then
the Allies could send detachments into France and
lay Picardy under contribution, or possibly carry
out the plan, rejected two years before, of a march
to the Seine. The King of Prussia's action only
made some bold stroke of the kind the more
imperative.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Stair had gained over the Austrian general D'Arenberg
to this project in 1742; but it was hardly likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>to be accepted by him now. Carteret, in forwarding
Stair's memorandum to Wade, gave him no positive
orders except at least to do something; but poor Wade
found it impossible to make the Austrians do anything.
The Allies having crossed the Scheldt halted inactive
for weeks, and no persuasion could induce D'Arenberg
to move. At last the army did march down to the
plains of Lille, but without its artillery, so that it
could not be said seriously to threaten the French
fortresses. The Dutch and Austrians had undertaken to
furnish a siege-train, but had taken no step to procure
one of the ten thousand horses that were required to
transport it. After a short sojourn in the south the
Allies marched helplessly northward once more. August
passed away and September came, but even in the
fourth month of the campaign the Dutch and
Austrians were still without their artillery.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Wade
boldly proposed to force Saxe's lines on the Lys:
the Austrians refused. He proposed to pounce on
a detachment of fourteen thousand men which Saxe
had imprudently isolated from his main army:
D'Arenberg carefully sent a weak body of cavalry
to reveal to the detachment the danger of its position.
Finally, in the first week of October, the Allies
retired into winter-quarters, which was precisely
the object for which D'Arenberg had been working
from the first. Despite the English subsidies, he
had no money with which to pay his troops, and he
wished to spare the Austrian Netherlands the burden
of furnishing forage and contributions. Wade, sick
in body and distressed in mind, at once resigned his
command. He had had enough of the Austrian
alliance, and King George before long was to have
enough of it also.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1745.</div>

<p>Once again, despite the endless length to which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>war was dragging on, the establishment of the British
forces remained virtually unaugmented for the year
1745. The troops allotted for service in Flanders
were indeed raised to a strength of twenty-five
thousand men, but this was effected only by reducing
the garrison of Great Britain to fifteen thousand,
which, as events were to prove before the year's
end, created a situation of perilous weakness. Moreover,
the past campaign had revealed a failing in
one of the confederated powers which was hardly
less serious than the impecuniosity and selfishness of
Austria. The Dutch army, which under Marlborough
had done such brilliant service, was become hopelessly
inefficient. The competition of rival demagogues
for popular favour had reduced it to such weakness
in numbers that it hardly sufficed to find efficient
garrisons for the fortified towns. Concurrently its
discipline had suffered, and General Ligonier had
already complained that the Dutch troops which
served with the Allies in 1744 were intolerably insubordinate
and disorderly, setting a bad example to the
whole army.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In February 1745 Ligonier again
brought the matter to the notice of the English
Government. The Dutch, he said, would probably
keep all their men in garrison, and if the Allies were
so weak that they could only find garrisons for the
fortresses on the frontier, the French would be free to
go where they pleased. It would be far better, therefore,
to make a great effort, collect a hundred thousand
men, take the offensive, and end the war in a single
campaign. Ten thousand men would be required to
guard the line of the Bruges Canal, and the remainder
should besiege Maubeuge and Landreçy and enter
France by the line of the Sambre, making the Meuse
the main line of communication, as open alike to the
passage of reinforcements from England, from Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and from Germany.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Such counsel was not likely to
find acceptance with the men who had mismanaged the
war so far. One important change, however, was
made by the appointment of the Duke of Cumberland
to be Commander-in-Chief in Flanders, and also in
Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The Duke at the time of this promotion
still wanted a month to complete his twenty-fifth year,
but he had from his boyhood been an enthusiastic
soldier, he had studied his profession, he had shown
bravery at Dettingen, and, young though he might be,
he was older than Condé had been when he first gained
military fame. Finally, it was an immense advantage
that a prince of a reigning family should preside over
so motley an army as that of the Allies, since there
would be the less disposition to cavil at his authority.</p>

<p>Cumberland entered upon his work energetically
enough, crossed over to Flanders early in April, made
all his arrangements for concentration at Brussels on
the 2nd of May, and actually began his march southward
on the following day.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Even so, however, Marshal
Saxe had taken the field before him, assembling his
troops in Hainault, as in the previous year, so that it
was impossible to divine which of the fortresses of the
barrier he might intend to attack. After a feint which
pointed to the siege of Mons, he marched rapidly upon
Tournay and invested it on the 30th of April, screening
his movements so skilfully with his cavalry that not a
word of his operations reached Cumberland until nearly
a week later. Cumberland, after leaving Soignies on
the 3rd of May, moved slowly south-westward by
Cambron, Maulbay, and Leuse, and arrived on the
evening of the 9th at Brissoel, within sight of Saxe's
army. The ground immediately in front of the Allies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>was broken by little copses, woods, and enclosures, all
of them crammed with mercenary irregular troops&mdash;Pandours,
Grassins, and the like&mdash;which, imitated first
from the Austrians, had by this time become a necessary
part of the French as of every army. Beyond this
broken ground a wide plain swept in a gentle, almost
unbroken slope to the village of Fontenoy, which formed
the centre of Saxe's position. The advanced parties of
irregulars, together with twelve squadrons drawn up
on the slope before Fontenoy, forbade Cumberland's
further advance for that day, and the Allies encamped
for the night. Headquarters were fixed at Maubray, a
village in full sight of Fontenoy, and a bare mile and a
half to the south-eastward of the French camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">April 29</span>
  <span class="blka over">May 10.</span>
</span></div>

<p>On the next day the French advanced posts were
pushed out of the copses, and Cumberland, together
with the Prince of Waldeck and the Count of
Königseck, who commanded the Dutch and the
Austrians respectively, went forward to reconnoitre
the position. Saxe's army occupied the crest of the
slope, lying astride of the two roads that lead from
Condé and from Leuse to Tournay. His right rested
on the village of Anthoin and on the Scheldt, the
tower of Anthoin Castle marking the western boundary
of his position with clearness enough. From thence
his line extended due east along the crest of the height
for nearly two miles to the village of Fontenoy. A
few hundred yards before Fontenoy stands the hamlet
of Bourgeon, but this was now veiled in smoke and
flame, having been fired by the Pandours as they retired.
From Anthoin to Fontenoy Saxe's front faced due
south, but eastward from Fontenoy it turned back almost
at right angles to the forest of Barry and the village
of Ramecroix, fronting considerably to eastward of
south. The village of Vezon, however, which lies in
the same straight line with Fontenoy due east of
Anthoin, was also occupied by the French as an
advanced post. This was quickly cleared by Cumberland's
troops, and the Allied Generals completed their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
reconnaissance. The position was undoubtedly strong
by nature and had been strengthened still further by
art. Beyond Anthoin the French right flank was
secured by a battery erected on the western bank of
the Scheldt, while the village itself was entrenched, and
held by two brigades. Between Anthoin and Fontenoy
three redoubts had been constructed, and the space
was defended by three brigades of infantry backed by
eight squadrons of horse. Fontenoy itself had been
fortified with works and cannon, and made as strong
as possible; and from Fontenoy to the forest of Barry
ran a double line of entrenchments, the first line held
by nine and the second by eleven battalions of infantry.
At the edge of the forest of Barry were two more
redoubts, the foremost of them called the Redoubt d'Eu,
both armed with cannon to sweep the open space
between the forest and Fontenoy; in rear of the forest
were posted nine more battalions, and in rear of all
two strong lines of cavalry. The flower of the French
army, both horse and foot, was stationed in this space
on Saxe's left, for the English had the right of the line
in the Allied Army, and Saxe knew the reputation of
the red-coats.</p>

<p>The Allied Generals decided to attack on the following
day. Königseck, it is said, was for harassing Saxe's
communications and compelling him to raise the siege
of Tournay; but finding himself overruled by Cumberland
and by Waldeck he gave way. Cumberland's
force was decidedly inferior in numbers, being less than
fifty thousand against fifty-six thousand men, but he was
young and impetuous, and had been strongly impressed
by the disastrous inaction of the preceding campaign. It
was agreed that the Dutch and Austrians should assail
the French centre and right, the Dutch in particular
being responsible for Fontenoy, while the British attacked
the French left between that village and the forest of
Barry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">April 30</span>
  <span class="blka over">May 11.</span>
</span></div>

<p>At two o'clock on the following morning the
British began to move out of their camp upon Vezon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the cavalry leading. The advance took much time, for
there were many narrow lanes to be traversed before
the force could debouch upon the slope, and when the
slope was passed it was still necessary to defile through
the village of Vezon. Cumberland's order of attack
was simple. Brigadier Ingoldsby, with the Twelfth
and Thirteenth Foot, the Forty-second Highlanders,
a Hanoverian battalion, and three six-pounder cannon,
was to assault the Redoubt d'Eu on the right flank of
the line of the British advance, and to carry it with the
bayonet. The remainder of the infantry was simply
to march up across the thousand yards of open ground
between it and Fontenoy and sweep the enemy out of
their entrenchments.</p>

<p>Before five o'clock the advanced squadrons of the
British horse, fifteen in all, under General Campbell,
had passed through Vezon and deployed in the plain
beyond, to cover the formation of the infantry for the
attack. The French batteries in Fontenoy and the redoubt
at once opened fire on them, but the cavalry
endured the fire for an hour unmoved, until at length a
shot carried away General Campbell's leg. The gallant
veteran, who had fought at Malplaquet, and was now
seventy-eight years of age, was carried dying from
the field, full of lamentation that he could take no
further part in the action. No one but himself seems
to have known for what purpose his squadrons had been
brought forward, and accordingly after his fall they
were withdrawn. The infantry then moved up to the
front, where General Ligonier proceeded to form them
in two lines, without further interruption, to use his own
simple words, than a lively and murderous cannonade
from the French. Cumberland meanwhile ordered up
seven six-pounders to the right of the British front,
which quickly came into action. Conspicuous before
the French front rode an officer on a white horse, and
the English gunners at once began to lay wagers who
should kill him. The second or third shot brought
the white charger to the ground, and his rider was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
carried, shattered and dying, to the rear. He was
Count Grammont, the gallant but thoughtless officer
who had spoiled the combinations of Noailles at
Dettingen. Then, turning to their more legitimate
work, the gunners quickly made their presence felt
among the French field-batteries; but the round shot
never ceased to plough into the scarlet ranks of the
British from Fontenoy and from the Redoubt d'Eu.
Ligonier's two lines of infantry were soon formed, with
the cavalry in two more lines in their rear, and the
General presently sent word to Cumberland that he was
ready to advance as soon as Waldeck should lead his
Dutch against Fontenoy. The name of the aide-de-camp
who carried this message should not be omitted,
for he was Captain Jeffery Amherst of the First
Guards.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Dutch and Austrians, in the centre
and left, advanced against Fontenoy and Anthoin, but
flinching from the fire in front, and above all from that
in their flank from the battery on the other side of the
Scheldt, soon shrank back under cover and could not be
induced to move forward again.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Worst of all, the
Dutch cavalry was smitten with panic, galloped back on
to the top of some of the British squadrons, and fled
away wildly to Hal crying out that all was lost. Things
therefore went ill on the Allied left; and meanwhile on
the right there was enacted a blunder still more fatal.
For Ingoldsby, misconceiving his instructions, hesitated
to make his attack on the Redoubt d'Eu, and despite
repeated orders from Cumberland never delivered it at
all. Cumberland, however, was impatient. Without
further delay he placed himself at the head of the
British, who were standing as Ligonier had arrayed
them, in most beautiful order. In the first line, counting
from right to left, stood a battalion of the First Guards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
another of the Coldstreams, and another of the Scots
Guards, the First, Twenty-first, Thirty-first, Eighth,
Twenty-fifth, Thirty-third, and Nineteenth; in the
second line the Buffs occupied the post of honour on
the right, and next to them came in succession the
Twenty-third, Thirty-second, Eleventh, Twenty-eighth,
Thirty-fourth, and Twentieth. Certain Hanoverian
battalions joined them on the extreme left. The
drums beat, the men shouldered arms, and the detachments
harnessed themselves to the two light field-guns
that accompanied each battalion. Ingoldsby
saw what was going forward and aligned his battalions
with them on the right. Then the word was given
to advance, and the two lines moved off with the
slow and measured step for which they were famous
in Europe.</p>

<p>Forward tramped the ranks of scarlet, silent and
stately as if on parade. Full half a mile of ground was
to be traversed before they could close with the invisible
enemy that awaited them in the entrenchments
over the crest of the slope, and the way was marked
clearly by the red flashes and puffs of white smoke that
leaped from Fontenoy and the Redoubt d'Eu on either
flank. The shot plunged fiercely and more fiercely into
the serried lines as they advanced into that murderous
cross-fire, but the gaping ranks were quietly closed, the
perfect order was never lost, the stately step was never
hurried. Only the Hanoverians in the second line,
finding that they were cramped for space, dropped back
quietly and decorously, and marched on in third line
behind the British. Silent and inexorable the scarlet
lines strode on. They came abreast of village and
redoubt, and the shot which had hitherto swept away
files now swept away ranks. Then the first line passed
beyond redoubt and village, and the French cannon
took it in reverse. The gaps grew wider and more
frequent, the front grew narrower as the men closed up,
but still the proud battalions advanced, strewing the
sward behind them with scarlet, like some mass of red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
blossoms that floats down a lazy stream and sheds its
petals as it goes.</p>

<p>At last the crest of the ridge was gained and the
ranks of the French battalions came suddenly into view
little more than a hundred yards distant, their coats
alone visible behind the breastwork. Next to the forest
of Barry, and exposed to the extreme right of the British,
a line of red showed the presence of the Swiss Guards;
next to them stood a line of blue, the four battalions
of the French Guards, and next to the Guards a line of
white, the regiments of Courtin, Aubeterre, and of the
King, the choicest battalions of the French army. Closer
and closer came the British, still with arms shouldered,
always silent, always with the same slow, measured
tread, till they had advanced to within fifty yards of the
French. Then at length Lord Charles Hay of the
First Guards stepped forward with flask in hand,
and doffing his hat drank politely to his enemies. "I
hope, gentlemen," he shouted, "that you are going to
wait for us to-day and not swim the Scheldt as you
swam the Main at Dettingen. Men of the King's
company," he continued, turning round to his own
people, "these are the French Guards, and I hope you
are going to beat them to-day"; and the English
Guards answered with a cheer. The French officers
hurried to the front, for the appearance of the British
was a surprise to them, and called for a cheer in reply,
but only a half-hearted murmur came from the French
ranks, which quickly died away and gave place to a few
sharp words of command; for the British were now
within thirty yards. "For what we are about to receive
may the Lord make us truly thankful," murmured an
English Guardsman as he looked down the barrels of
the French muskets, but before his comrades round him
had done laughing the French Guards had fired; and
the turn of the British had come at last.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>For despite that deadly march through the cross-fire
of the French batteries to the muzzles of the French
muskets, the scarlet ranks still glared unbroken through
the smoke; and now the British muskets, so long
shouldered, were levelled, and with crash upon crash
the volleys rang out from end to end of the line, first
the First Guards, then the Scots, then the Coldstreams,
and so through brigade after brigade, two battalions
loading while the third fired, a ceaseless, rolling, infernal
fire. Down dropped the whole of the French front
rank, blue coats, red coats and white, before the storm.
Nineteen officers and six hundred men of the French
and Swiss Guards fell at the first discharge; regiment
Courtin was crushed out of existence; regiment
Aubeterre, striving hard to stem the tide, was swept
aside by a single imperious volley which laid half of its
men on the ground. The British infantry were perfectly
in hand; their officers could be seen coolly tapping the
muskets of the men with their canes so that every
discharge might be low and deadly, and nothing could
withstand their fire; while the battalion guns also poured
in round after round of grape with terrible effect. The
first French line was utterly shattered and broken.
Even while the British were advancing Saxe had
brought up additional troops to meet them and had
posted regiments Couronne and Soissonois in rear of
the King's regiment, and the Brigade Royal in rear of
the French Guards; but all alike went down before
the irresistible volleys. The red-coats continued their
triumphant advance for full three hundred yards into
the heart of the French camp, and old Ligonier's heart
leaped within him, for he thought that the battle was
won.</p>

<p>Saxe for his part thought little differently from
Ligonier; but though half dead with dropsy, reduced
to suck a bullet to assuage his intolerable thirst, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
weak that he could not ride but was carried about the
field in a wicker litter, the gallant German never for a
moment lost his head. Sending a message to the
French King, who with the Dauphin was watching the
action from a windmill in the rear, to retire across the
Scheldt without delay, he strove to gain time to rally
his infantry. On the first repulse of the French Guards
Cumberland had detached two battalions to help the
Dutch by a flanking attack on Fontenoy. Seeing that
this movement must be checked at all hazards, Saxe
headed these troops back by a charge of cavalry;
whereupon one of the battalions extended itself along
the left flank of the British. Partly in this way, partly
owing to the incessant play of the French artillery on
both flanks, the two British lines assumed the form of
two huge oblong columns which gradually became
welded into one. The change was not untimely, for
now the first line of the French cavalry, which had
been posted in rear of the forest of Barry, came down
upon the British at full gallop, but only to reel back
shivered to fragments by the same terrible fire. Then
the second line tried its fortune, but met with no better
fate. Finally, the Household Cavalry, the famous
Maison du Roi, burning with all the ardour of Dettingen
unavenged, was launched against the scarlet columns,
and like its predecessors, came flying back, a mob of
riderless horses and uncontrollable men, decimated,
shattered and repulsed by the never-ending fire. "It
was like charging two flaming fortresses rather than
two columns of infantry."<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless some time was hereby gained for the
broken French infantry to reform. The British, once
arrived within the French camp, came to a halt, and
looked at last to see how the Dutch were faring on
their left. As has already been told, Waldeck's attack
had been a total failure, and the British, unsupported
and always under a cross-fire of artillery, fell back to
the crest of the ridge and were reformed for a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
attack. Waldeck undertook to make another attempt
on Fontenoy, and Cumberland in reliance upon his
help again advanced at the head of the British. But
meanwhile Saxe had brought forward his reserves from
Ramecroix, and among them the Irish brigade, to meet
him, while artillery had also been brought up from
the French right to play upon the British front. The
French Guards and the rest of the troops of the French
first line had also been rallied, and the task of the
British was well-nigh desperate. The Irish brigade,
which consisted of six battalions, was made up not of
Irish only but of Scots and English also, desperate
characters who went into action with a rope round
their necks, and would fight like devils. Yet, even
in this second attack the British carried their advance
as far as in the first, the perfection of their fire-discipline
enabling them to beat back even the Irish
brigade for a time. But their losses had been frightfully
heavy; the Dutch would not move one foot
to the attack of Fontenoy, and the cannonade in
front added to that in the flanks became unendurable.
The French infantry likewise closed round on
them in superior numbers on both flanks, and it
became apparent that there was nothing for it but a
retreat.</p>

<p>Ligonier sent back two battalions to secure the
roads leading through Vezon, and the retreat then
began in perfectly good order. The French Household
Cavalry made a furious charge upon the rear of
the column as it faced about, but found to its cost that
the infernal fire was not yet quenched. The three
battalions of Guards and a battalion of Hanoverians
turned sternly about to meet them, and gave them a
few parting volleys, which wholly extinguished one
regiment and brought down every officer of another.
A few British squadrons, the Blues conspicuous among
them, pushed forward, in spite of heavy losses, through
the cross-fire to lend what help they could, and the
remnant of the heroic battalions retired, facing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in succession at every hundred yards, as steadily and
proudly as they had advanced.</p>

<p>Their losses in the action were terribly severe. Of
the fifteen thousand infantry, English and Hanoverian,
for the Hanoverians bore themselves not less nobly
than their Allies, nearly six thousand were killed or
wounded, the casualties of the twenty English battalions
just exceeding four thousand men. The heaviest
sufferers were the Twelfth and Twenty-third regiments,
both of which lost over three hundred men, the Twenty-first
and Thirty-first, which lost rather less than three
hundred men apiece, and the three battalions of Guards,
which lost each of them about two hundred and fifty.
Of the Generals of Foot, Cumberland, Ligonier, and
Brigadier Skelton, though in the hottest of the fire,
alone came off unhurt; all of the rest were either killed
or wounded. Many regiments of cavalry also suffered
not a little, in particular the Blues and Royal Dragoons;
and the total loss of the British cavalry exceeded three
hundred men and six hundred horses. The loss of
the French was never made public, but was certainly
at least equal to that of the Allies. Contemporary
accounts set it down, with no great improbability, at
fully ten thousand men. As an example of the prowess
of British infantry, Fontenoy stands almost without a
parallel in its history. The battalions formed under
a cross-fire of artillery, remained halted under the same
fire, advanced slowly for half a mile in perfect order
under the same fire, and marched up to within pistol-shot
of the French infantry to receive their volley before
they discharged a shot. They shattered the French
battalions to pieces, repulsed three separate attacks of
cavalry, halted under a heavy cannonade, retired for
some distance and reformed under a cross-fire, advanced
again with both artillery and musketry playing on front
and flanks, made the bravest brigade in the French
service recoil, repelled another desperate attack of
cavalry, and retired slowly and orderly under a cross-fire
almost to the end. By consent of all the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
commanders it was Ingoldsby's misunderstanding of
his orders and his failure to capture the Redoubt d'Eu
that lost the battle; and Ingoldsby was duly tried by
court-martial for his behaviour. He was, however,
acquitted of all but an error in judgment; and indeed
there was no question of cowardice, for he accompanied
the remainder of the infantry in its advance with his
own detachment and was severely wounded. It is
customary to blame Cumberland for dashing his head
against a wall in attempting such an attack, but he
could hardly have been expected to count on such bad
luck as the failure of Ingoldsby on one flank and of
the Dutch on the other. The sheer audacity of his
advance went near to give him the victory. Saxe owned
that he never dreamed that any General would attempt
such a stroke, or that any troops would execute it.
Cumberland is blamed also for not attacking either the
Redoubt d'Eu or Fontenoy after he had penetrated into
the French camp. This charge is less easy to rebut,
for the French always know when they are beaten, and
seeing their left rolled up and troops advancing on
Fontenoy in flank and rear would probably have given
up the game for lost, and that the more readily since
their ammunition in Fontenoy was for the moment
nearly exhausted. Even so, however, Saxe's reserves
were always at hand at Ramecroix, and would have
required to be held in check. Another puzzling
question, namely, why Cumberland did not make greater
use of his artillery in the action, is answered by the
fact that the contractors for the horsing of the guns
ran off with the horses early in the day. Such an
occurrence was by no means unusual, and yet it never
happened to Marlborough, not even at Malplaquet.
Altogether, the conclusion seems to be that Cumberland
stumbled on to a brilliant feat of arms by mistake,
and, though seconded by his troops with bravery equal
to his own, was not a General of sufficient capacity to
turn his success to account.</p>

<p>At the close of the action Cumberland retreated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Ath and encamped under the guns of that fortress,
leaving his wounded to the mercy of the French, who,
by a strange perversion of their usual chivalry, treated
them with shameful barbarity. Among the wounded,
strangely enough, were a few of the new sect of
Methodists founded by John Wesley, who faced death
and wounds with the stern exultation that had once
inspired the troopers of Cromwell. One of them wrote
to Wesley, that even after a bullet in each arm had
forced him to retire from the field, he hardly knew
whether he was on earth or heaven, such was the
sweetness of the day. This man and a few more of
his kind probably helped their fellow-sufferers through
the misery of the days following the battle, until
Cumberland's furious remonstrances with Saxe procured
for them better treatment.</p>

<p>From Ath Cumberland fell back to Lessines and
drew out such British corps as were in garrison in
Flanders to replace those which had suffered most
heavily in the action. Meanwhile Tournay, very shortly
after the battle, fell by treachery into the hands of the
French; and Saxe's field-army being thus raised to a
force nearly double that of the Allies, Cumberland was
reduced to utter helplessness. The mischief of Fontenoy
lay not in the repulse and the loss of men, for the
British did not consider themselves to have been beaten,
but in the destruction of all confidence in the Dutch
troops. The troubles which had harassed Wade to
despair now reappeared. Cumberland, despite his
inferiority in strength, was expected somehow to defend
Flanders, Brabant, and above all Brussels, and yet
simultaneously to keep an active army in the field.
Worse than this, he attempted to fulfil the expectation.
Against his better judgment he weakened his force still
further by detaching a force for the garrison of Mons,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and then, instead of taking up a strong position on the
Scheldt to cover Ghent at all hazards, he yielded to
the pressure of the Austrians and crossed the Dender
to cover Brussels.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Halting too long between two
opinions he at last sent off a detachment for the defence
of Ghent, half of which was cut off and turned back
with heavy loss, while the other half, after enduring
much rough usage on the march, entered Ghent only
to see the town surprised by the French on the following
day. Four British regiments took part in this
unlucky enterprise and suffered heavy loss, while the
Royal Scots and the Twenty-third, which had been
despatched to Ghent after Fontenoy, of course became
prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Moreover, a vast quantity of British military
stores were captured in Ghent, although Cumberland
had a week before ordered that they should be removed.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
After this blow Cumberland retired to Vilvorde, a little
to the north of Brussels, still hoping to cover both that
city and Antwerp, and so to preserve his communications
both with Germany and with the sea. Here again he
sacrificed his better judgment to the clamour of the
Austrians, for he would much have preferred to secure
Antwerp only. His position was in fact most critical,
and he was keenly alive to it.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Just when his anxiety
was greatest there came a letter from the Secretary
of State, announcing that invasion of England was
imminent, and hoping that troops could be spared from
Flanders without prejudice to his operations. "What!"
answered Ligonier indignantly, "Are you aware that
the enemy has seventy thousand men against our thirty
thousand, and that they can place a superior force on
the canal before us and send another army round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>between us and Antwerp to cut off our supplies and
force us to fight at a disadvantage? This is our position,
and this is the result of providing His Royal
Highness with insufficient troops; and yet you speak
of our having a corps to spare to defend England!"<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>Saxe's plan for reducing the Allies was in fact
uniformly the same throughout the whole of the war,
namely to cut off their communications with the sea on
one side and with Germany on the other. Even before
he began to press Cumberland northward toward
Antwerp he had detached a force to lay siege to Ostend,
which was the English base. Cumberland, on his side,
had advised that the dykes should be broken down and
the country inundated in order to preserve it, and both
Dutch and Austrians had promised that this should be
done; but as usual it was not done, and before the end
of August Ostend had surrendered to the French. The
English base was then perforce shifted to Antwerp.
But by this time the requests for the return of troops
to England had become urgent and imperative orders.
First ten battalions were recalled, then the rest of the
foot, and at last practically the whole of the army, including
Cumberland himself.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> It is now time to explain

<p class="noindent">Ever since the death of Cardinal Fleury, in January
1743, the hopes of the Jacobites for French help in
an attempt to re-establish the Stuarts by force of arms
had been steadily reviving. Cardinal Tencin, Fleury's
successor, was warmly attached to the cause of the
exiled house; the feeling between France and England
was greatly embittered; the beginning of overt hostilities
could be only a matter of time; and an invasion
of Britain was the most powerful diversion that could
be made to divide the forces of the partisans of the
Pragmatic Sanction. In the autumn of 1743 preparations
for a descent upon England from Dunkirk under
Marshal Saxe were matured, and a French fleet, with
Saxe and Prince Charles Stuart on board, actually sailed
as far as Dungeness. There, however, it was dispersed
by a storm, which wrecked many of the transports, and
for the present put an effectual end to the enterprise.</p>

<p>Prince Charles returned to Paris not a little disappointed,
but receiving no further encouragement from
France nourished the hope of landing in Scotland and
making his attempt with the aid of his British adherents
only. Those adherents for their part had warned him
that success was hopeless unless he should bring with
him at least six thousand men and ten thousand stand
of arms; but Charles was none the less determined to
try his fortune. The defeat of the British at Fontenoy
doubtless strengthened his resolution: in June 1745 he
came to a definite decision, and on the 25th of July he
landed at Loch-nan-Uamh, between Moidart and Arisaig,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
with seven companions, of whom one only besides himself,
Sir John Macdonald, had any experience of the
military profession. Three weeks before his actual
arrival a rumour of his landing had reached Sir John
Cope, the General commanding in Scotland, who recommended
that all officers should be recalled to their posts,
and that every precaution should be taken.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Even so,
however, Charles had been on Scottish soil a full week
before Cope could believe the rumour to be true.</p>

<p>The three persons on whom the Government chiefly
relied for the safety of Scotland were Cope himself,
Andrew Fletcher, the Lord Justice-Clerk, and Duncan
Forbes, the Lord President: but the only man in
authority who at once betrayed serious apprehension
was the Lord Advocate Craigie, who had been dreading
some such complication ever since Fontenoy. Cope also
was uneasy, owing to the extreme weakness of the force
at his disposal. He had not, in all, more than three
thousand men, for the most part new and raw regiments
upon which he could repose little trust, and which in
spite of his representations in the previous year were
not even properly armed.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> He resolved, however, to
march northward at once in order to overawe any
waverers by a display of force: and on receiving at last,
after long delay, absolute confirmation of the news of the
Pretender's disembarkation, he threw his most trustworthy
regiment, the Sixth Foot, with two companies of
the Royal Scots, into the forts which protected the line
of Loch Lochy and Loch Ness.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> It was, however,
impossible for him to move without first making provision
for the subsistence of his little army, and this was
a work of much time and difficulty. It was not until
the 19th of August that he finally marched from
Edinburgh for Fort Augustus with fifteen hundred men
of the Forty-fourth, Forty-sixth, and Forty-seventh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>Foot, and a convoy of stores so large as greatly to
impede his movements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile affairs had assumed a far more dangerous
complexion. Charles had been active in summoning the
leaders of the clans on which he counted; and though
less favourably received than he had hoped he had
secured Cameron of Lochiel, Macdonald of Keppoch,
Macdonald of Glengarry, and others. On the 16th of
August a party of Keppoch's and Lochiel's men
succeeded in cutting off two companies of the Royal
Scots which were on their way to Fort Augustus, killed
a dozen of them, and took the rest prisoners: and on
the 19th, the very day of Cope's departure from Edinburgh,
Charles raised his standard at Glenfinnan, to find
himself on the next day at the head of sixteen hundred
men.</p>

<p>Cope had not yet received full intelligence of these
transactions, but it was pretty evident to him that
his advance to the north was likely to be something
more than a mere military promenade, and he became
extremely unwilling to execute it. Yielding, however,
to positive orders from the Lords-Justices<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> he
continued his march upon Fort Augustus, not a little
disgusted to find that, though he had encumbered
his train with several hundred stand of arms for distribution
to loyal volunteers, no such volunteers were
forthcoming to receive them. Charles, for his part,
on receiving information of Cope's approach, with
great promptitude made a forced march to Corry
Arrack, the worst pass on the road, and having disposed
his troops with great skill, waited exultingly for
the coming of the red-coats that he might overwhelm
them during their passage of the defile.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> To his surprise
not a man appeared. Cope had been made aware of his
dispositions and had turned aside from Dalwhinnie to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>Inverness, leaving the road to the south open to the
rebels. From Inverness he despatched urgent messages
to Edinburgh for transports to convey his troops
southward by sea.</p>

<p>Cope has always been greatly blamed for this movement,
the contention being that he should either have
maintained his ground in front of Charles or have
fallen back on Stirling. All critics, however, overlook
the crucial points, that not only was his force inferior
to that of the rebels but that he could not trust a man
of them. Charles's Highlanders could march two
miles to Cope's one, and would have made short work
of a large convoy in charge of undisciplined troops.
Again, if Cope had halted, the rebels would have been
on him in a few hours before he had had time to
entrench himself, even supposing that he could have
found entrenching tools. The fact that he sent for
transports shows that he would not rely upon his troops
in a retreat; the advance northward was undertaken
contrary to his advice, and the misfortune that followed
was simply the usual result of civilians' interference
with military operations.</p>

<p>Charles, on his side, lost no time in following up
his advantage, and at once pushed rapidly southward.
One of his parties was, indeed, repelled by the minute
English garrison which held the post at Ruthin,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> but
his men indemnified themselves by bringing in Macpherson
of Cluny a prisoner, and thereby gaining Lord
Lovat and the Frasers to the cause. By the 30th of
August Charles had reached Blair Athol, and on the
4th of September he entered Perth, where he was joined
by James Drummond, titular Duke of Perth, and
Lord George Murray, both of them valuable acquisitions
for the following that they brought with them,
while Murray was, in addition, a very skilful officer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Resuming his march on the 11th, he avoided the
guns of Stirling Castle by fording the Forth eight
miles above the fortress, and took up his quarters
in the town of Stirling, which had opened its gates
to him. By the 15th he was within eight miles of
Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The city was in consternation over his approach.
The Castle of Edinburgh was, indeed, provided with
an adequate garrison, but the town was absolutely
defenceless; nor were there any regular troops at hand
excepting the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dragoons,
both of them young regiments, raw and untrained.
On the morning of the 16th these two corps, together
with a party of the town-guard, were drawn up at
Coltbridge, when their picquets were suddenly driven
in by the pistol-shots of a few mounted gentlemen of
the rebel army. The picquets were seized with inexplicable
panic, which presently communicated itself to
the main body; and in a few minutes both regiments,
despite the entreaties of their officers, were off at full
gallop to the south, never stopping until they reached
Preston. They had not been there long before the
panic was rekindled. One of the dragoons, while in
search of forage after dark, fell into a disused coal-pit
full of water and shouted lustily for help. Instantly
the cry was raised that the Highlanders were on them,
and the men, rushing to their horses, galloped away
once more through the night, and could not be halted
till they reached Dunbar. The "Canter of Coltbrigg,"
as this ludicrous but shameful flight was dubbed, was
the source of all the subsequent success of the
Pretender. So petty are the causes that will go near
to overset a throne. Probably, if the truth of the
matter could be known, it would be found that a few
raw horses, unbroken to fire-arms, among the picquets
were the cause of the whole disaster.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
moment, however, the panic was decisive in its results.
Charles entered Edinburgh without resistance on the
following day and took up his quarters at Holyrood;
but halting for no more than twenty-four hours in the
capital he pursued his march to the south. His troops
by this time had swelled to twenty-five hundred men,
though many of these were indifferently armed, and the
force was absolutely destitute of artillery. Still happy
chance had sent panic in advance of him, and he wisely
followed it with all possible speed.</p>

<p>Cope, meanwhile, on hearing of the march of the
rebels southward had moved from Inverness to
Aberdeen, where, on the arrival of transports from
Edinburgh, he embarked his men and arrived safely
on the 16th of September at Dunbar. On the two
following days the troops were disembarked, and the
army, being reinforced by two hundred Highland levies
under Lord Loudoun, and by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
Dragoons, was raised to a total of twenty-three
hundred men, with six guns. On the 19th Cope
marched northward along the coast road, and on the
following day caught sight of the rebels, not, as he
had expected, to westward, but to southward of him,
quietly halted on the brow of Carberry Hill. He at
once took up a strong position, with his rear resting
on the sea, his left being covered by a marsh and his
right by two enclosures with walls seven feet high,
between which ran the road to the village of Prestonpans.
In his front lay another enclosure surrounded
by a ditch from ten to twelve feet broad; and thus
naturally entrenched, Cope's force might well have
seemed unassailable. The rebels, however, moved down
from the hill and took up their position opposite to the
marsh on Cope's right. Cope therefore changed front
to the left so as to rest his right on the ditch and his
left on the sea, thus presenting his front to the marsh,
an alteration which appeared to offer the rebels little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
advantage. In the course of the evening, however, a
man well acquainted with the marsh pointed out to the
rebel commanders a passage by which it might safely
be traversed; and in the course of the night Charles
threw his army safely across and formed it for attack
in two lines&mdash;twelve hundred men in the first, and the
remainder, who were but ill-armed, in the second line.
His new position was not more than two hundred yards
from the English camp, for Cope, deeming the marsh
impassable, had omitted to post a single guard or sentry
on that side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">

  <span class="blka over">October 2.</span>
</span></div>

<p>A little before daybreak the alarm was given in
Cope's camp, and the General hastened to form his line
of battle, with his infantry, as usual, in the centre,
the Thirteenth Dragoons on his right wing, and the
Fourteenth Dragoons on his left. The Highlanders
were no sooner formed than Charles gave the signal
for attack. They rushed forward with a yell upon the
artillery before Cope's front, and drove the gunners,
who were seamen from the fleet, away from their guns.
Then, firing a volley at the dragoons, they rushed
straight upon them with the broadsword and slashed
furiously at the noses of the horses. The dragoons,
already too well inured to panic, at once wheeled
about in confusion. The infantry, though uncovered
on both flanks, remained steady and poured in a
destructive fire, but the Highlanders immediately
closed with them, and the bayonet was no match for
broadsword and target. In a few minutes the English
were broken and flying for their lives. Four hundred
were cut down on the spot and over a thousand more
were taken prisoners, one hundred and seventy only
succeeding in making their escape. The loss of the
rebels was no more than thirty killed and seventy
wounded. The whole action did not last ten minutes,
and yet never was victory more complete. The
dragoons were so thoroughly scared that, after galloping
first to Edinburgh, where the Governor indignantly
refused to admit them to the Castle, they turned round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and hurried south to Berwick, where Cope had already
arrived before them.</p>

<p>The moral effect of Prestonpans was prodigious.
Twice the English troops had faced the Highlanders,
and each time they had fled in panic. On the first
occasion no blood had been shed, but Prestonpans
brought with it a memory and a tradition of horror,
for all of the slain English had perished by the sword,
and the field presented a frightful spectacle of severed
limbs and mutilated bodies. Charles was for taking
advantage of the moment and marching immediately
upon London; and if he had done so it is probable
that he would at least have reached the capital. There
was little or no enthusiasm among the English for
the cause of the Guelphs, and there were few or no
troops to stand in Charles's way; there was only one
fortified place, Newcastle, to trouble him to the south
of the Tweed, and the whole district was profoundly
scared. But the Highlanders were already hurrying
homeward with the plunder gained by the action,
diminishing the strength of his force by one-half; so that
it was deemed more prudent to return to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Charles's great object now was the reduction of
Edinburgh Castle, which with Stirling Castle and the
forts in the Highlands was practically all of Scotland
that remained to the Guelphs. A blockade of a few
weeks would have forced it to submission by famine,
but General Guest, the Governor, threatened to lay the
town in ashes if his supplies were cut off. A few shots
from his cannon showed that he was in earnest, and, in
deference to the entreaties of the townsfolk, Charles
was fain to let him have his way. The circumstance
might in itself have sufficed to show the futility of
military operations on such terms, but the gain of
certain prominent Scottish nobles to the cause, and the
addition of several hundred volunteers to the rebel
army, seemed to afford some compensation for this
enforced inactivity. By the end of October Charles's
force was augmented to six thousand men, five-sixths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of them excellent material, while its efficiency was
further heightened by the arrival of several French and
Irish officers, who brought with them money, five
thousand stand of arms, and six pieces of field artillery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile military preparations went forward in
England with feverish activity. Cumberland, as has
already been told, received orders to send back first a
part, and then the whole of his army: and now the full
peril of the situation in Flanders can be realised. It is
plain from Ligonier's letters that Saxe had it in his
power to destroy the British force encamped at Vilvorde,
and that one good soldier at least lived in daily dread of
the catastrophe. Had Ligonier's apprehension been
fulfilled the throne of the Guelphs must have fallen:
and the fault would have been King George's own, for
his folly in trifling with the war for two campaigns
instead of pursuing it vigorously as Stair had advised.
As things were, however, the British passed the North
Sea in safety, together with certain Dutch and Hessians
who had been summoned, as in 1715, the help of
England in pursuance of the Treaty. The Dutch indeed
arrived before the British could be despatched, and thus
of ten battalions placed under the command of Marshal
Wade for the defence of the kingdom no fewer than
seven were foreign.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Pending the arrival of the troops
from over sea frantic efforts were made to fill the ranks,
as usual much depleted by drafts, of the regiments at
home. On the 6th of September a bounty of no less
than six pounds was offered to every recruit who would
join the Guards before the 24th, and of four pounds to
any enlisting between the 24th and the 1st of October.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
The spirit of the country also began slowly to kindle:
and the newspapers fanned the rising flame by an incessant
blast of "No popery, no arbitrary power, no
wooden shoes."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Fifteen leading noblemen offered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>raise and equip two regiments of horse and thirteen of
foot at their own expense. The gentlemen of Yorkshire
raised a Royal Regiment of Hunters, first germ of our
present Yeomanry, which served without pay. Companies
of volunteers were formed in London. The
peaceful Quakers combined to present every soldier with
a flannel waistcoat for the coming winter campaign: and
a subscription was started in the City to provide a
blanket and two paillasses to each tent, thirty watch-coats
to each battalion, and a pair of worsted gloves to
every man.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The militia also was called out in several
counties: and finally Cope was removed from the
command in Scotland and replaced by General Handasyde.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Charles in the meantime was anxious to move southward
with the least possible delay, and fight the motley
force which was gathered together under Wade at
Newcastle;<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> but his Scottish adherents were most unwilling
to move, and it was only when he declared his
determination to enter England alone, if no one would
follow him, that they grudgingly consented to march for
a little distance over the border. Lord George Murray
with great wisdom advised that the advance should be
through Cumberland rather than Northumberland, which
would compel Wade to harass his troops by marches
along bad roads through a difficult country. If Wade
should remain inactive, which his previous behaviour in
command suggested to be more than likely, the rebels
would be at liberty to move whither they pleased. The
better to conceal the true direction of the advance the
army was divided into two columns, the one under
Charles himself to march by way of Kelso and the other
by way of Moffat, both to converge ultimately on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>Carlisle. Thus at length, on the 31st of October, the
rebels began their advance southward, but still in no
very good heart. The letters of the chiefs show that
they looked upon the whole enterprise as desperate, and
that they longed to be at their homes reaping their
harvest, and looking to the wintering of their herds.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
The rank and file of the Highlanders did not write
letters, but simply betook themselves in scores to their
homes.</p>

<p>Murray's plan of invasion succeeded admirably. On
his arrival at Kelso Charles sent forward an advanced party
to order quarters at Wooler, and having thus alarmed
Wade for Newcastle turned sharply to the westward and
entered Cumberland by Liddesdale. On the following
day he was joined by the other column, and the united
army, some five thousand strong, proceeded to the
investment of Carlisle. The town was held only by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
garrison of militia, but the commander and the mayor
refused to surrender, and the siege was delayed by a
false alarm that Wade was marching to rescue. On the
13th of November, however, batteries were raised by
the rebels, whereupon the mayor's courage evaporated
and his worship requested a capitulation for the town.
Charles refused to grant it unless the Castle also was
included, and the result was that he gained both Castle
and town with the loss of hardly a man. Wade, when
it was too late, started to relieve Carlisle, but, being
stopped by a fall of snow, returned again to Newcastle,
and sent General Handasyde with two battalions of foot
and a regiment of dragoons to re-occupy Edinburgh.
This movement increased the anxiety of the Highlanders
to return home: but after some debate it was decided
to continue the advance. Two hundred men were left
to garrison Carlisle, and with a force greatly reduced
by desertion Charles, on the 20th, renewed his march
to the south without the least molestation from Wade.
On the 27th he passed the Ribble, that barrier so often
fatal to Scottish invasion, at Preston, where he was well
received, and a few recruits were added to his army.
Acclamations, too, greeted him on his way to Wigan
and Manchester, but the people refused to accept the
arms that were offered to them or to enlist themselves
for his cause. Only at Manchester the exertions of Mr.
Francis Townley, a Roman Catholic of a very old family
in the county, availed to raise a couple of hundred men.
It was but a trifling addition compared with that expected
by the Highland chiefs, and served to confirm their misgivings
as to the desperate character of the enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 4.</div>

<p>English troops now began to close in upon the little
rebel army from every side. Wade was moving down
upon it from the north; Cumberland lay before it with
eight thousand men at Lichfield, while a still larger
force of militia, stiffened by battalions of the Guards,
was in process of concentration at Finchley Common for
the defence of London. Still the rebels pursued their
march southward, the people staring at them as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
passed, amused but indifferent, and apparently hardly able
to take the matter seriously. At Cambridge sensible
middle-aged men talked of taking a chaise to go and see
them on the road;<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> and Hogarth, to the great good
fortune of posterity, could see nothing in the march of
the Guards to Finchley but an admirable subject for the
exercise of his pencil and the indulgence of his satire.
Yet there was still a panic in store for London. From
Macclesfield Lord George Murray sent forward a small
force to Congleton, which pushed away a party of horse
that lay there and pursued it for some way along the
road to Newcastle-under-Lyme. Cumberland, thinking
that the rebels were about to advance by that line or
turn westward into Wales, turned also westward to Stone
to intercept them, and Murray, making a forced march
eastward, reached Ashbourne and on the following day
entered Derby. By this manœuvre the rebel army had
gained two marches on Cumberland and successfully
passed by the most formidable force interposed between
it and London. The capital was in consternation.
Business was suspended, all shops were shut, and the
Bank of England only escaped disaster by making its
payments in sixpences in order to gain time. Cumberland
on discovering his mistake hurried his cavalry by
desperate marches to Northampton in order to regain,
if possible, the ground that he had lost, but the only
result was utter exhaustion of the horses; and the Duke
of Richmond, who was in command of this cavalry,
frankly confessed that he did not see how the enemy
could be stopped. The rapidity of the rebels' movements,
the difficulty of moving regular troops during the
winter along execrable roads, and above all the want of
an efficient head at Whitehall to replace the timid and
incompetent Newcastle, served to paralyse the whole
strength of England.</p>

<p>On the night of his arrival at Derby Charles discussed
at length the question of the dress which he should wear
on his entry into London; but on the following day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
his officers represented to him the danger of further
advance, with Wade and Cumberland closing in upon his
rear. News had arrived of the landing of French troops
at Montrose; it would be better, they urged, to retreat
while there was yet time and to join them. Charles
combated the proposition hotly for the whole day, but
yielded at last; and on the morrow the retreat was
begun. Cumberland, who had fallen back to Coventry,
at once caught up four thousand men and followed the
rebels by forced marches, but did not overtake them
until the 18th, when his advanced parties made an
attack on Murray's rear-guard at Clifton Moor, a few
miles to the south of Penrith. The English, however,
were repulsed with the loss of a hundred men, a misadventure
easily explained by the fact that the action was
fought after dark, when the musket was a poor match
for the claymore. Still the repulse was not creditable to
the royal troops nor encouraging for further attempts
upon the rebel rear-guard. Wade meanwhile made no
attempt to intercept the northward march of Charles,
who crossed the Esk into Scotland unmolested on the
20th of December, and six days later occupied Glasgow.
His force, despite many days of halt, had covered the
distance from Edinburgh to Derby and from Derby back
to Glasgow in exactly eight weeks. A few days later he
resumed his march to Stirling, where he was joined by the
French, who had landed at Montrose, and by other levies
which, notwithstanding General Handasyde's entreaties
that they might be attacked from Edinburgh and
Inverness, had been allowed to assemble in the north.
These reinforcements augmented his strength to nine
thousand men: and since the French had brought with
them battering guns Charles resolved to besiege the
Castle of Stirling and so to secure for himself, if possible,
all Scotland north of the Firths of Forth and Clyde.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cumberland after recovering Carlisle had
been recalled to the south of England with most of his
infantry to guard the southern coast in case of a French
invasion. Wade, who was quite worn out with age and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
infirmity, was also removed from his command, and at
Cumberland's nomination General Hawley was appointed
to be Commander-in-Chief in Scotland. Hawley was a
man of obscure origin, rough and brutal in manners, but
a strict disciplinarian of the ruder school which was beloved
of Cumberland, and very far from an incapable
soldier. On his arrival at Edinburgh he found himself
entrusted with twelve battalions and four regiments of
dragoons, and with absolute liberty to do with them as
he thought best. Still his difficulties were considerable.
Artillery had been given to him but no gunners, his
instructions being that he should draw the latter from
the garrisons of Berwick and of Edinburgh. On being
summoned, however, these gunners proved to be civilians
who had been foisted on to the establishment for the
sake of their votes, and were not intended to be of any
other service.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> The same principle could be traced in
every other detail relating to these two garrisons, for
the trail of corruption was over all.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Many of the
battalions again were no better than militia, and the
infantry generally was in so bad a state that it was hard
to raise above three or four thousand men fit for service
from the whole of it. "I hope we shan't be blamed,"
wrote Hawley, in explaining his inaction, "but it is not
the name of twelve battalions that will do the business.
No diligence in me shall be wanting, but a man cannot
work without tools. The heavy artillery is still at
Newcastle for want of horses, which were sent to Carlisle
for no use. The major of artillery is absent through
sickness. I suspect his sickness to be a young wife: I
know him. I have been obliged to hire a conductor of
artillery, and seventy odd men to act as his assistants for
the field-artillery. I was three days getting them from
the Castle to the Palace-yard and now they are not fit
to march."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> At length by great exertion the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>force of twelve battalions and three regiments of
dragoons, with its artillery, was made ready for the field.
Hawley then moved up to Falkirk on the way to relieve
the beleaguered Castle of Stirling, and encamped on the
western side of the town.</p>

<p>The rebels so far had made little progress with the
siege. The French engineer with them, who was a coxcomb
of little skill, had chosen wrong sites for his
batteries, and General Blakeney, who was in command
of the garrison, had made him sensible of the fact by a
most destructive fire. On the 16th of January Charles,
hearing of Hawley's march upon Falkirk, left a few
hundred men to maintain the blockade of the Castle, and
advanced with the remainder to Bannockburn, where he
drew them up, as on a field of good omen, in order of
battle. Hawley, however, declined to move, his artillery
being but just come up: so on the following day
Charles determined to attack him. While he was
moving forward Hawley was enjoying the hospitality of
Callendar House from Lady Kilmarnock, wife to one of
the rebel leaders, having left General Huske, an excellent
officer, in command. Manœuvring with a small detachment
to distract Huske's attention to the northward
along the road that leads to Stirling, Charles led his
army to the south of the English camp, and then advanced
upon it towards a ridge of rugged upland known
as Falkirk Muir. The English drums promptly beat
to arms, and urgent messages were despatched to
Callendar House for Hawley, who presently galloped
up at speed without his hat. Hastily placing himself at
the head of the three regiments of dragoons he hurried
with them in the teeth of a storm of rain and wind to
the top of Falkirk Muir, ordering the foot to follow
with bayonets fixed. The rebels however reached the
summit of the ridge before him; and Hawley then
formed his army on the lower ground, drawing up the
infantry in two lines, with the cavalry before them on
the left of the first line. His left was covered by an
impassable morass, and thus it came about that the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of the rebels, who were also formed in two lines, stood
opposite to his centre. The numbers of each army
were about nine thousand men. The formation of the
British being complete, Hawley, who had great faith in
the power of cavalry against the Highlanders, ordered
the dragoons to attack. They advanced accordingly.
The Highlanders waited with perfect coolness until they
were within ten yards of them, and then poured in an
effective volley. Therewith the evil tradition of panic
seized at once upon the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
Dragoons, which turned about and galloped off in
disorder. The Ninth Dragoons showed more firmness,
but the Highlanders throwing themselves on the ground
thrust at the bellies of the horses with their dirks, and
they also were beaten back. Then the Highlanders
advanced, and the foot, shaken by the defeat of the
horse and blinded by wind and rain, fired an irregular
volley. One-fourth of the muskets missed fire owing
to the rain, and every regiment excepting two at once
turned and fled. No efforts of their officers, who
behaved with the greatest gallantry, had the least effect
in stopping them, though many were regiments of famous
reputation; and the Highlanders pursuing with the
claymore made not a little havoc among the fugitives.
On the right of the first line, however, the Fourth and
Forty-eighth stood firm, their front ranks kneeling with
bayonets fixed while the middle and rear ranks fired,
and repulsed the left wing of the rebels: the Fourteenth
soon rallied and joined them, the Royal Scots and Buffs
rallied also, and these troops keeping up a steady fire
made, with the Ninth Dragoons, an orderly retreat.
The losses did not exceed two hundred and eighty of all
ranks, killed, wounded or missing, the two regiments
that stood firm coming off with little hurt, the Forty-eighth
indeed without injury to a man.</p>

<p>The action cannot be called a great defeat if a defeat
at all, but it was a disgrace, and Hawley felt it to be so.
"My heart is broke," he wrote to Cumberland, "I can't
say we are quite beat, but our left is beat and their left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
is beat.... Such scandalous cowardice I never saw
before. The whole second line of foot ran away without
firing a shot." It may well be that Hawley's absence
during the preliminary manœuvres of the rebel army
and his hurried arrival immediately before the action
contributed to make the troops unsteady, but in reality
there was nothing to excuse their precipitate flight
except that, as Hawley had himself written from
Edinburgh, they were little better than militia. The
truth was, that by constant talk of the desperate prowess
of the Highlanders and by endless gloating, such as the
ignorant delight in, over the horrors of the field of
Prestonpans, the men had worked themselves into a
state of almost superstitious terror.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Such a thing is
not rare in military history and has, unless I am mistaken,
been seen again in our own army within our own
time.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Hawley was soon able to report that the whole of
his force had recovered itself with the exception of the
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Dragoons, which appear to
have been hopelessly demoralised. Nor can it be denied
that the General's remedies were stern enough. "There
are fourteen deserters taken," he wrote, a fortnight after
the action, "shall they be hanged? Thirty-one of
Hamilton's dragoons are to be hanged for deserting to
the rebels, and thirty-two of the foot to be shot for
cowardice."<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Still it was felt that there was but one
way thoroughly to restore the spirit of the troops,
namely that the Duke of Cumberland should take command
of them in person. The Duke no sooner received
his orders than he hurried to Edinburgh, travelling night
and day with such speed that he accomplished the
journey from London in less than six days. Neither he
nor the King blamed Hawley. Indiscipline was in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>opinion the reason for the failure, and he came up to
Scotland fully resolved to put an end to it. He seems
in fact to have joined the army, asking in scornful and
indignant surprise what was the meaning of this foolish
flight of English infantry before wild Highlanders:
and this attitude was almost sufficient in itself to put
the soldiers upon their mettle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Feb. <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over">12</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>Hawley had made all preparations for an advance
against the Duke's arrival, and on the 31st of January
Cumberland moved forward to Falkirk with twelve
battalions of foot, two regiments of dragoons, in which
neither the Thirteenth nor the Fourteenth was included,
and several companies of loyal Highlanders. The
rebels thereupon raised the siege of Stirling and retired,
much against the will of Charles, to Inverness, leaving
their battering guns in the trenches behind them.
Cumberland at once sent forward his dragoons in
pursuit, and pushed on as rapidly as possible to Perth.
He was in no amiable mood, and gave an indication of
his feelings towards the rebels by granting his troops
licence to plunder the estates of rebel leaders on the
march.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Arriving at Perth he was detained for several
days by the difficulty of collecting supplies and transport.
Nevertheless the campaign was at last to be
conducted with common sense. Cumberland was careful
to give his troops special training against their
enemy, prescribing for the infantry the formation so
successfully adopted by the Fourth and Forty-eighth at
Falkirk, and directing that when at close quarters with
Highlanders each soldier should turn his bayonet not
against the enemy immediately before him, but against
the man on his own right front, where the target could
not parry the thrust. But this, though creditable to
Cumberland, was of small importance compared to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
change in the general situation. The rebels were in full
retreat from the fertile lowlands into the barren mountains,
and their supplies from France were cut off by
British ships of war, while Cumberland's force was fed
from the sea. When one army is full and another
starving, lead and steel are hardly needed to decide the
victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">Feb. 18</span>
  <span class="blka over">March 1.</span>
</span></div>

<p>Nevertheless, even after his retreat from Stirling
Charles met with some trifling successes. Inverness,
when he reached it, was held by Lord Loudoun with
some raw Highland levies. Loudoun made a night
march in the hope of seizing Charles's person at Moy
Castle, some ten miles distant; but half a dozen of the
rebel Highlanders, firing a few shots and raising the
war-cry of their clans, kindled the inevitable panic, and
Loudoun's men ran away to Inverness in such disorder
that he decided to evacuate the town, and retired across
the Moray Firth. In the course of the evacuation panic
again overtook his men, and fully a third of them
deserted.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Charles occupied the town on the following
day, and thus obtained a port into which such French
ships as might elude the British cruisers could bring him
supplies. Another of his parties, again, contrived to
capture Fort Augustus, together with three companies
of the Sixth Foot which formed its garrison. But his
attempts against Fort William and Blair Castle were
fruitless, for both posts though besieged, and the latter
indeed hard pressed, held out with the greatest firmness
and determination. Thus the barrier of Loch Lochy
and Loch Ness was never wholly broken through.</p>

<p>During all this time Cumberland's temper was steadily
rising. For all his impatience, his operations were
delayed by bad weather and difficulties of transport;
though his troops scoured the country overawing and
disarming the inhabitants he could obtain no intelligence
of the rebels whatever; and the petty defeat of Loudoun,
though of no very great importance, was from its moral
effect extremely irritating. Throughout the month of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
March he remained at Aberdeen unable to move; and
meanwhile a further revival of the spirit of panic exasperated
him beyond measure. Five thousand Hessians
under Prince Frederick of Hesse-Cassel had been taken
into British pay, landed in Scotland, and posted at Perth
to check any attempt of the rebels to return to southward.
On the intelligence of a petty inroad of rebel
parties upon Blair and Rannoch Prince Frederick actually
decided to evacuate Perth and fall back to Stirling.
Cumberland was no sooner apprised of this decision than
he ordered the Hessians forward to relieve Blair Castle,
but the Prince from sheer timidity shrank from any
attempt to execute the command. Fortunately Blair
was able to defend itself: but Cumberland did not fail
to let the Prince know what he thought of his conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
April <span class="blkb">

</span>.</div>

<p>At length on the 8th of April the Duke was able to
advance from Aberdeen, and having crossed the Spey
successfully on the 12th, pushed forward by forced
marches upon Nairn. On the evening of the 14th his
advanced parties had a brush with the rebels' rear-guard,
and he knew that his enemy lay at last within his reach.
Charles lodged for that night at Culloden House, some
twelve miles from Nairn, while his troops, now reduced
to five thousand starving, dispirited men, bivouacked on
Culloden Moor. On the following day he drew up his
army in order of battle; but the Duke had granted his
troops a halt at Nairn after their exertions, and the more
readily since the 15th was his birthday. Charles therefore
formed the bold design of surprising him in his
camp on that same night; but though his troops were
actually set in motion for the purpose, the men were too
weak from privation to traverse the distance within the
appointed time; and they fell back weary and despondent,
having fatigued themselves to no purpose. Charles's
officers were now for moving to some stronger position,
but the young Prince's head seems to have been turned
by his previous successes, and he resolved to accept battle
where he stood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
April <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">16</span>
  <span class="blka over">27</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>Between four and five in the morning of the next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the Duke broke up from Nairn, and after a march of
eight miles received intelligence from his advanced parties
that the rebels were in his front. He at once formed
in order of battle, but finding that the enemy did not
come forward, continued his march. The rebels were
formed in two lines, their right resting on some straggling
park walls and huts, their left extending towards Culloden
House. The Duke's army was disposed in three lines,
the two first consisting each of six battalions of infantry
and two regiments of dragoons, while the Highland
irregulars formed the third line. The entire force
numbered about ten thousand men with ten guns, which
were stationed in pairs between the battalions of the
first line. "Now," said the Duke, turning to his men
when all was in order, "I don't suppose that there are
any men here who are disinclined to fight, but if there
be, I beg them in God's name to go, for I would rather
face the Highlanders with a thousand resolute men at
my back than with ten thousand half-hearted." The
men answered with cheers, and there could be little doubt
as to the issue of the battle. Hawley and the dragoons
were then sent forward to break down the enclosures on
the enemy's right, and at ten o'clock the rebels opened
the action with a discharge from their artillery.</p>

<p>The Duke's cannon instantly took up the challenge;
but the duel could not last long, for Charles's guns were
ill-aimed and ill-served, whereas the British fire was most
accurate and destructive. The right and centre of the
Highlanders, unable to endure the grape, presently rushed
forward, swept round the left of the British line upon
the flank and rear of the Fourth and Twenty-seventh
Regiments, and for a short time threw them into some
confusion. At every other point, however, they were
speedily driven back by a crushing fire, and the Fourth
and Twenty-seventh, recovering themselves, turned
bayonet against claymore and target for the first time
with success. In utter rage at this repulse the rebels for
a few minutes flung stones at the hated red-coats; but
by this time Hawley had broken through the enclosures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and turned four guns upon Charles's second line. On
the left of the rebels the Macdonalds, sulking because
they had not the place of honour, refused to move, and
now the English dragoons burst in upon the Highlanders
from both flanks, and, charging through them till they
met in the middle, shivered them to fragments. The
rout of the enemy was complete and the dragoons
galloped on to the pursuit. One thousand of Charles's
troops were killed on the spot, and five hundred prisoners,
of whom two hundred were French, were taken. The
remainder fled in all directions. The loss of the Duke's
army was slight, barely reaching three hundred men
killed and wounded, of whom two-thirds were of the
Fourth and Twenty-seventh. The victory was decisive:
the rebellion was crushed at a blow, and all hopes of a
restoration of the Stuarts were at last and for ever
extinguished.</p>

<p>The campaign ended, as a victorious campaign
against mountaineers must always end, in the hunting
of fugitives, the burning of villages, and the destruction
of crops. To this work the troops were now let loose,
as they had already been in the march to Perth, though
now with encouragement rather than restraint, and with
no attention to "proper precautions." But enough and
too much has been written of the inhumanity which
earned for Cumberland the name of the butcher; his
services were far too valuable to be overlooked, and
himself of far too remarkable character to be tossed aside
with the brand of a single hateful epithet. Charles
Edward, and Murray, the ablest of his officers, had
turned the gifts which fortune gave them, and the
peculiar powers of their little force in rapidity of movement
and vigour of attack, to an account which entitles
them to very high praise as commanders. It was by
such bold actions as Falkirk and Prestonpans, and by
such skilful manœuvres as left Wade astern at Newcastle
and Cumberland at Stone, that our Indian Empire was
won. Thus it was against no unskilful leaders that
Cumberland was matched; and on taking the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
he found the British regular troops in a state of demoralisation,
through repeated panic, which is almost
incredible. Whole regiments were running away on
the slightest alarm, in spite of the heroism of their
officers; and even a General, a foreigner and a royal
prince, Frederick of Hesse-Cassel, prepared to retreat
at the mere rumour of the approach of a few score of
Highlanders. To all this, Cumberland, by the prestige
of his position and rugged force of character, put an end.
He was called up, young as he was, to a duty from
which almost every General in Europe, of what experience
soever, would have shrunk&mdash;a winter campaign in
a mountainous country. Ninety-nine men out of a
hundred would have waited for the summer, and indeed
such delay was expected of Cumberland, but he pressed
on to his task at once. He restored the confidence of
his troops partly by the dignity of his station, partly by
his own ascendency as a man, partly by his skill as a
soldier, encouraging them not by mere words only, but
also by training them to meet the peculiar tactics of a
peculiar enemy by a new formation and a scientific, if
simple, method of using the bayonet. He pursued his
work persistently, despite endless difficulties, disappointments,
and vexations, and did not rest until he had
achieved it completely. Jacobitism, which had been the
curse of the kingdom for three quarters of a century,
was finally slain, and the Highlanders, who had been a
plague for as long and longer, were finally subjugated,
for no one's advantage more than for their own. The
methods employed were doubtless harsh, sometimes even
to barbarity, being those generally used by barbarians
towards each other and therefore held inexcusable among
civilised men; but it is not common for half-savage
mountaineers&mdash;and the Highlanders were little else&mdash;to
be brought to reason without some such harsh lesson.
Military execution, as it was called, was not yet an
obsolete practice in war, whether for injury to the enemy
or indulgence of the troops, while Tolpatches, Pandours,
and other irregular bands, whose barbarities were unspeakable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
were esteemed a valuable if not indispensable
adjunct to the armies of the civilised nations of Europe.
Moreover, French regular troops behaved quite as ill
in Germany during the Seven Years' War as any of
the irregulars. Still wanton brutality and outrage, however
excused by the custom of war, must remain unpardoned
and unpardonable, on the score not only of
humanity but of discipline. But though the blot upon
Cumberland's name must remain indelible, it should
not obscure the fact that, at a time of extreme national
peril, the Duke lifted the army in a few weeks, from the
lowest depth which it has ever touched of demoralisation
and disgrace, to its old height of confidence and self-respect.</p>

<p class="noindent">The virtual evacuation of the Low Countries by the
British in consequence of the Jacobite Rebellion was an
advantage too obvious to be overlooked by the French.
At the end of January, though winter-quarters were not
yet broken up, they severed the communication between
Antwerp and Brussels, and a week later took the town
of Brussels itself by escalade. The citadel, after defending
itself for a fortnight, went the way of the town, and
the capital of the Spanish Netherlands was turned into a
French place of arms.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The consternation in Holland
was great, and it was increased when the French
presently besieged and captured Antwerp. Meanwhile
the British Commander, Lord Dunmore, who had been
left in the Netherlands with a few squadrons of cavalry,
could only look on in utter helplessness. It was not
until June that the Hessian troops in British pay and a
few British battalions could be embarked, together with
General Ligonier to command them, from England;
and it was not until July, owing to foul winds, that
they were finally landed at Williamstadt. The change
of base was significant in itself, for since the capture of
Ostend and Antwerp there was no haven for British
ships except in the United Provinces. Even after the
disembarkation these forces were found to be still unready
to take the field. The Hessians had not a grain
of powder among them, and there were neither horses
for the artillery nor waggons for the baggage. Again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to add small difficulties to great, the Austrian General,
Batthyany, having no British officer as his peer in command,
denied to the British troops the place of honour
at the right of the line. It was a trifling matter, but yet
sufficient to embarrass counsel, destroy harmony, and
delay operations.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>While the Allies were thus painfully drawing their
forces together, the activity of the French never ceased.
The Prince of Conti was detached with a considerable
force to the Haine, where he quickly reduced Mons and
St. Ghislain, thus throwing down almost the last relics of
the Austrian barrier in the south. Thence moving to
the Sambre, Conti laid siege to Charleroi. It was now
sufficiently clear that the plan of the French campaign
was to operate on the line of the Meuse for the invasion
of Holland. Maestricht once taken, the rest would be
easy, for most of the Dutch army were prisoners in the
hands of the French; and with the possession of the line
of the Meuse communication between the Allied forces
of England and of Austria would be cut off. But
before Maestricht could be touched Namur must first
be captured; and the campaign of 1746 accordingly
centred about Namur.</p>

<p>For the first fortnight of July the Allies remained
at Terheyden, a little to the north of Breda, Saxe's army
lying some thirty miles south-westward of them about
Antwerp. On the 17th of July the Allies at last got on
march, still with some faint hopes of saving Charleroi,
and proceeded south-eastward, a movement which Saxe
at once parried by marching parallel with them to the
Dyle between Arschot and Louvain. Pushing forward,
despite endless difficulties of transport and forage,
through a wretched barren country, the Allies, now
under command of Prince Charles of Lorraine, reached
Peer, turned southward across the Demer at Hasselt,

were thus actually on the eastern side of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
main army, within reach of the Mehaigne and not
without good hope of saving Namur if not Charleroi.
On the 1st of August they crossed the Mehaigne, only
to learn to their bitter disappointment that Charleroi
had surrendered that very morning. Saxe meanwhile,
with the principal part of his army, still lay entrenched at
Louvain with detachments pushed forward to Tirlemont
and Gembloux. The Allies continued their march before
the eyes of these detachments to Masy on the Orneau,
and there took up a position between that river and the
head-waters of the Mehaigne, fronting to the north-east.
This was the line approved through many generations
of war as the best for the protection of Namur.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Saxe now drew nearer to them, and the two armies
lay opposite to each other, in many places not more than
a musket-shot apart, both entrenched to the teeth.
The Allies so far had decidedly scored a success, but
they were outnumbered by the French by three to two,
and they were confined within a narrow space wherein
subsistence was extremely difficult; while if they moved,
Namur was lost. Ligonier, who was most uneasy over
the situation, longed for five thousand cavalry with
which to make a dash at Malines and so call the enemy
back in haste to defend Brussels and Antwerp.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Prince
Charles, however, was averse to operations of such a
nature. His hope was that Saxe would offer him battle
on the historic plain of Ramillies where, notwithstanding
the disparity of numbers, he trusted that the quality of
his troops and the traditions of the field would enable
him to prevail. But Saxe had no intention of doing
anything of the kind. He did indeed shift his position
further to the north and east, with the field of Ramillies
in his rear, but it was not to offer battle. Pushing out
detachments to eastward he captured Huy, and cutting
off the Allies' communications with Liége and Maestricht
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>forced them to cross the Meuse and fall back on
Maestricht from the other side of the river. Cross the
Meuse the Allies accordingly did, unmolested, to
Ligonier's great relief, by twenty thousand French who
were stationed on the eastern bank of the stream.
They then opened communication with Maestricht, five
leagues away, while Saxe extended his army comfortably
with its face to the eastward along the line of the Jaar
from Warem to Tongres, waiting till want of forage
should compel the Allies to recross the Meuse. Back
they came over the river within a fortnight, as he had
expected, and the Marshal, without attempting to dispute
the passage, retreated quietly for a few miles, knowing
full well that his enemy could not follow him from lack
of bread. Ligonier never in his life longed so intensely
for the end of a campaign.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>On the 17th of September the Allies advanced upon
the French and offered battle. Saxe answered by retiring
to an impregnable position between Tongres and
the Demer. There was no occasion for him to fight,
when his enemies were short of provisions and their
cavalry was going to ruin from want of forage. So
there the two armies remained once more, within sight
of each other but unwilling to fight, since an attack on
the entrenchments of either host would have entailed
the certain destruction of the attacking force. But
meanwhile the trenches had been opened before Namur
by a French corps under the Prince of Clermont,
and within nine days the town had fallen. Ligonier
again urged his design, for which he had prepared the
necessary magazines, to upset Saxe's plans by a dash
upon Antwerp, but he could find no support in the
council of war; so there was nothing for the Allies to
do but to wait until some further French success should
compel them to move. Such a success was not long in
coming. The castle of Namur surrendered after a
miserable defence of but eleven days; Clermont's corps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was released for operations in the field, and the Allies
were forced to fall back for the protection of Liége.
Accordingly, on the 7th of October they crossed the
Jaar, not without annoyance from the enemy, and took
up a new position, which gave them indeed possession of
Liége, but placed them between the Meuse in their
rear, and an enemy of nearly twice their strength on
the Jaar before their front.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">

  <span class="blka">Sept. 29</span>
  <span class="blka over">Oct. 10.</span>
</span></div>

<p>Now at last Saxe resolved to strike a blow. On
the 10th of October he crossed the Jaar with evident
intention of an attack, and the Allied army received
orders to be ready for action before the following dawn.
The Allies' position faced very nearly due west, the
army being drawn up astride of the two paved roads
leading into Liége from Tongres and St. Trond. Their
extreme right rested on the Jaar and was covered by
the villages of Slins, Fexhe, and Enick, all of which
were strongly entrenched and occupied by the Austrians.
South of Enick extended an open plain from that village
to the village of Liers, and in this plain was posted the
Hanoverian infantry and four British battalions, the
Eighth, Nineteenth, Thirty-third, and Forty-third Foot,
with the Hessian infantry on their left in rear of Liers.
The Hanoverian cavalry prolonged the line southward
to the village of Varoux, and the Sixth and Seventh
Dragoons and Scots Greys continued it to the village
of Roucoux, from which point Dutch troops carried it
on to the village of Ance, which formed the extreme
left of the position. Ligonier did not like the situation,
for he did not see how the turning of the left flank
could be prevented if, as would certainly be the case,
the French should seriously attempt it. Prince Charles,
knowing that if his right were turned his retreat to
Maestricht would be cut off, had taken care to hold
the right flank in real strength and dared not weaken it;
but the position, with the Meuse in its rear, was perilously
shallow, while the convergence of two ravines from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Jaar and Melaigne into its centre allowed of but
one narrow way of communication between the right
and left of the army. The defects of the Allies' dispositions
were in fact not unlike those which had
proved fatal to King William at Landen, and Ligonier's
anxiety was proved to rest on all too good foundation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">Sept. 30</span>
  <span class="blka over">Oct. 11.</span>
</span></div>

<p>The morning of the 11th of October opened with
bad news for the Allies. The French had been admitted
into Liége by the inhabitants behind the backs
of the Dutch, so that the Prince of Waldeck, who,
commanded on the left, was obliged to withdraw eight
battalions from Roucoux and post them <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en potence</i> on
his left flank, with his cavalry in support. Thus the
defence of Roucoux, as well as of Liers and Varoux, was
left to eight battalions of British, Hanoverians, and
Hessians only. This made the outlook for the Allied
left the worse, since it was evident that the brunt of the
French attack would fall upon it. Saxe gave Prince
Charles little time for reflection. He had one hundred
and twenty thousand men against eighty thousand, and
he knew that of the eighty thousand at least one-third
were tied to the Austrian entrenchments about the Jaar.
He opened the action by a furious assault upon the
Dutch on the left flank, his infantry being formed in dense
columns, so that the attack could be renewed continually
by fresh troops. Simultaneously fifty-five battalions
in three similar columns were launched upon Liers,
Varoux, and Roucoux. Outmatched though they were,
Dutch, Germans, and British all fought splendidly and
repelled more than one attack. But, to use Ligonier's
words, as soon as two French brigades had been repulsed
in each village, a third brigade ran in; and the eight
battalions, though they still held Liers, were forced to
withdraw both from Roucoux and Varoux. Being
rallied, however, by Ligonier, they advanced again and
recaptured both villages; and the Nineteenth and
Forty-third took up a position in a hollow road which
they held to the last. The Dutch now began to retire
across the rear of the position from the left, in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
order despite heavy losses, while Ligonier checked the
enemy in the plain with the British cavalry. When the
Dutch had passed he ordered his own men to retreat in
the same direction, still covering the movement with
the cavalry and with the Thirteenth and Twenty-sixth
Foot, which had been sent to the field from the garrison
of Maestricht. The Austrians formed a rear-guard
in turn when the British and their German comrades
had passed, and thus the whole army filed off, unpursued
and in perfect order, and crossed the Meuse in
safety on the following morning.</p>

<p>The action may be looked upon as a fortunate
escape for the Allies, since it was impossible, humanly
speaking, that it could have issued favourably for them.
Prince Charles, in seeking to cover both Liége and
Maestricht, had attempted too much. His army thus
occupied too wide a front, the villages in the centre
were too weakly held, there was hardly anywhere a
second line of infantry, and the left flank could not be
sustained against so superior an enemy. The total loss
of the Allies was about five thousand men, which was
sufficiently severe considering that but a third of the
army was engaged. The casualties of the British were
three hundred and fifty killed and wounded, of whom
no fewer than two hundred belonged to the Forty-third.
The French lost as many men as the Allies, or more,
and gained little by the action except eight guns captured
from the British, Hanoverians, and Hessians.
Had not the Allied troops been far better in quality
and discipline than the French, they must have been lost
during their retreat with superior numbers both in flank
and rear. Both armies presently retired into winter-quarters,
and the campaign ended far less disastrously
than might have been feared for the Allies.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, it was not in Flanders only
that discredit fell upon the British arms. At the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of September a force of six battalions<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> was sent, under
command of General St. Clair, to the coast of Brittany to
attack Port L'Orient and destroy the stores of the
French East India Company there. The enterprise
was conducted with amazing feebleness. The troops
landed at Quimperle Bay practically unopposed, but,
being fired at on their march on the following day, were
turned loose to the plunder of a small town as a punishment
to the inhabitants for their resistance. On the
following day they reached L'Orient, which the Deputy
Governor of the East India Company offered to surrender
on good terms. His overtures, however, were
rejected and a siege was begun in form; but after a
few days of firing and the loss of about a hundred men
killed and wounded, St. Clair thought it prudent to
retreat; and on the 12th of October the troops re-embarked
and returned to England. Anything more
pointless than the design or more contemptible than the
execution of this project can hardly be conceived, for it
simply employed regiments, which were badly needed
in Flanders and America, in useless operations which
did not amount to a diversion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747.</div>

<p>If the cause of Queen Maria Theresa was to be
saved, it was evident that great efforts were imperative
in the coming campaign of 1747. To meet the vast
numbers brought into the field by the French the Austrians
promised to have sixty thousand men at Maseyck
on the Meuse by April; the British contributed four
regiments of cavalry and fourteen battalions of infantry;
and it was hoped that the Allies would take the field
with a total strength of one hundred and ten battalions,
one hundred and sixty squadrons, and two hundred and
twenty guns, besides irregular troops, the whole to be
under command of the Duke of Cumberland.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Unfortunately
the weather was adverse to an early opening
of the campaign; and the French, by the seizure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Cadsand and Sluys, which were shamefully surrendered
by the Dutch, closed the southern mouth of the Scheldt
below Antwerp. This was a sad blow to the arrangements
for the transport of the Allies, since it brought
about the necessity of hauling all the forage for the
British overland from Breda. Had Cumberland been
in a position to open the campaign before the French, he
meant to have laid siege to Antwerp; as things were,
he was compelled, thanks chiefly to the apathy of the
Dutch, to attempt to bring Saxe to a general action.
His last letter before beginning operations has, however,
an interest of another kind. It contains a recommendation
that Major James Wolfe may be permitted
to purchase a vacant lieutenant-colonelcy in the Eighth
Foot, that officer having served constantly and well
during the past two years as a major of brigade and
proved himself capable and desirous to do his duty.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>The French being encamped between Malines and
Louvain, Cumberland collected his troops at Tilburg
and advanced straight upon them, encamping on the 26th
of May on the Great Nethe, a little to the east of
Antwerp, between Lierre and Herenthout. Saxe,
entrenched as usual to the teeth, remained immovable
for three weeks, and Cumberland despaired of bringing
him to action. At length the news that a detached
corps of thirty thousand French, under the Prince of
Clermont, was on the old ground about Tongres, moved
Cumberland to march to the Demer, in the hope of
overwhelming Clermont before Saxe could join him.
Saxe, however, was on his guard, and on the 29th of
June prepared to concentrate the whole of his army at
Tongres. Cumberland thereupon decided to take up
Saxe's camp of the previous year, from Bilsen, on the
head-waters of the Demer, to Tongres. So sending
forward Count Daun, afterwards well known as an
antagonist of Frederick the Great, with a corps of
Austrians to occupy Bilsen, he ordered the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
army to follow as quickly as possible on the next day.
Riding forward at daybreak of the morrow, Cumberland
was dismayed to see the French advancing in two
columns from Tongres, as if to fall upon the head of his
own army. This was a surprise. Cumberland knew that
Saxe was in motion but had not expected him so soon;
and indeed Saxe had made a notable march, for his army
had not left Louvain until the 29th of June and had
traversed little less than fifty miles in two days. The
Duke lost no time in setting such troops as were on the
spot in order of battle, and hurried away to see if those
on the march could be brought up in time to force back
the French, and to secure the position of his choice. But
the French cavalry was too quick for him, and, before
Ligonier could bring up the English horse, had occupied
the centre of the ground which Cumberland had intended
for himself. Ligonier drew up his squadrons
before them to bar their further advance, and the Allied
infantry, as it came up, was formed in order of battle,
fronting, however, not to eastward, as had been originally
designed, but almost due south. In fact, owing to Saxe's
unexpected arrival and to deficient arrangements by the
staff of the Allies, there seems to have been considerable
delay in putting the Allied army into any formation at
all, or the French might certainly have been forced
back to Tongres. Saxe's rear had not yet come up
and the men were fatigued by a long and harassing
march; but Cumberland was not the man to fight an
action of the type of Oudenarde, and the opportunity
was lost.<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Missing anchor for footnote 232 inserted here">
   <a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></ins></p>

<p>The position now occupied by the Allies extended
from some rising ground known as the Commanderie, a
little to the south-east of Bilsen, along a chain of
villages and low heights to the Jaar, a little to the south
of Maestricht. The Commanderie being the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the line was held by the Austrians, with a strong corps
thrown back <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en potence</i> to Bilsen to protect the right
flank; for it was as important on this field as on that
of Roucoux that the retreat into Holland should not
be cut off. The ground possessed natural features of
strength which were turned to good account, so good
account indeed that the Allied right, like the French
left at Ramillies, could neither attack nor be attacked.
Eastward from the Commanderie the Austrians occupied
the heights of Spaeven, together with the villages of
Gross and Klein Spaeven; next to them the Dutch
formed the centre of the line, while the Hanoverians
and British held the villages of Val, or Vlytingen, and
Lauffeld, and prolonged the line to its extreme left at
the village of Kesselt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">June 21</span>
  <span class="blka over">July 2.</span>
</span></div>

<p>There the Allies lay on their arms until nightfall,
while Saxe's weary battalions tramped on till far into
the night up to their bivouacs. At daybreak the French
were seen to be in motion, marching and countermarching
in a way that Cumberland did not quite understand;
the fact being that Saxe, as at Roucoux, was doubling
the left wing of his army in rear of the right, for the
formation of those dense columns of attack which he
could handle with such consummate skill. After observing
them until nine o'clock Cumberland came to the
conclusion that the Marshal meditated no immediate
movement and retired to the Commanderie for breakfast;
but he had hardly sat down when an urgent
message arrived from Ligonier that the enemy was on
the point of attacking. Cumberland at once returned
and moved the left of his line somewhat forward,
setting fire to the village of Vlytingen and occupying
Lauffeld with three British and two Hessian battalions.
Lauffeld was a straggling village a quarter of a mile
long, covered by a multitude of small enclosures with
mud walls about six feet high, topped by growing
hedges. It was thus easily turned into a strong post
for infantry, and cannon were posted both in its front
and flanks. The remainder of the British were drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
up for the most part in rear of Lauffeld in order to feed
and relieve its garrison, the brigade of Guards being
posted in the hedges before Vlytingen. The British
cavalry stood on the <ins class="corr" title="Errata&mdash;Original text: 'left'">right</ins> of the infantry and joined their
line to that of the Dutch.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Saxe, sending forward a cloud of irregular
troops to mask his movements, had despatched
Count d'Estrées and the Count of Segur with a strong
force of infantry and cavalry to seize the villages of
Montenaken and Wilre on the left flank of the Allies.
This service was performed with little loss. At the
same time he directed the Marquis of Salières, with six
brigades of foot and twenty guns, to attack Vlytingen,
and launched five brigades, with as many guns, backed
by a large force of cavalry, against Lauffeld. The
assault of the French infantry upon Lauffeld was met by
a furious resistance. It was just such another struggle
as that of Neerwinden, from hedge to hedge and from
wall to wall; and the French, for all their superiority
of numbers, were driven back headlong from the village
with terrible loss. Salières met with little better success
against the brigade of Guards in the hedges of
Vlytingen; but with great readiness he turned half
of his guns to his right against Lauffeld and the remainder
against a ravine on his left, with most
destructive effect. Cumberland, observing the fury with
which Saxe had concentrated his attack against these
two villages, asked the Austrians to relieve him by a
diversion upon his right; but the Austrian troops could
not face the fire of Salières' guns, and it became clear
that Vlytingen and Lauffeld must be held by the British
and Hanoverians alone.</p>

<p>Saxe's first attack had been brilliantly repulsed.
He at once replaced the beaten troops by two fresh
brigades of infantry, with cavalry to support them, and
renewed the assault, but with no better success. The
British were driven back from the outer defences only
to stand more fiercely by those within, and Lauffeld
remained unconquered. But Saxe was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
deterred from his purpose. Two more brigades, including
the six Irish battalions that had saved the day at
Fontenoy, were added to those already on the spot, and
the whole of them launched for a third attack against
Lauffeld. They were met by the same stubborn resistance
and the same deadly fire; and the Irish brigade
lost no fewer than sixty officers in the struggle. Nevertheless
Irish impetuosity carried the rest of the troops
forward; the British were borne back to the rearmost
edge of the village and the French began to swarm up
the slope beyond it. Cumberland promptly ordered the
whole of his line of infantry to advance; and the French
at once gave way before them. The French cavalry was
obliged to drive the foot forward at the sword's point, but
Cumberland continued steadily to gain ground despite
their efforts. Then at an unlucky moment, some Dutch
squadrons in the centre were seized with panic and came
galloping straight into the British line, carried away the
Hessians and one squadron of the Greys and fell pell-mell
upon the Twenty-first and Twenty-third Fusiliers.
The Twenty-first, anticipating the treatment of the
Belgians at Waterloo, gave the Dutchmen a volley and
partly saved themselves, but the Twenty-third suffered
terribly and the whole line was thrown into confusion.
Before order could be restored Salières had thrown three
more brigades upon Lauffeld, which closed in round it,
blocking up a hollow road which formed the entrance
into it from the rear, and barring the way for all
further reinforcements of the Allies. The few troops
that were left in the village were speedily overpowered,
and Lauffeld was lost.</p>

<p>Some of Daun's Austrians now advanced to
Cumberland's help from the right; but three French
brigades of cavalry that were waiting before Vlytingen
at once moved forward to check them, and charging
boldly into them succeeded in turning them back,
though themselves roughly handled when retiring from
the charge. Meanwhile Saxe had brought up ten guns
to right and left of Lauffeld, and reinforcing the cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of D'Estrées and Segur extended it in one long line
from Lauffeld to Wilre, for a final crushing attack on
the Allied left. Order had been restored among the
British infantry, who were now retreating with great
steadiness, but they were wholly unsupported. Ligonier,
determined to save them at any cost, caught up the
Greys, Inniskillings, and Cumberland's dragoons, and
led them straight against the masses of the French
cavalry. The gallant brigade charged home, crashed
headlong through the horse, and fell upon the infantry
beyond, but being galled by their fire and attacked in
all quarters by other French squadrons, was broken
past all rallying and very heavily punished. Ligonier
himself was overthrown and taken prisoner. Cumberland,
who had plunged into the broken ranks to try to
rally them, was cut off by the French dragoons, and
only with difficulty contrived to join the remainder of
his cavalry on the left. With these he covered the
retreat of the army, which was successfully effected in
good order and with little further loss.</p>

<p>So ended the battle of Lauffeld, in which the
British bore the brunt with a firmness that extorted the
praise even of Frenchmen, but of which few Englishmen
have ever heard. The troops, in Cumberland's
words, behaved one and all so well that he could not
commend any one regiment without doing injustice to
the rest. The total loss of the five regiments of horse
and fourteen battalions of foot was close upon two
thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The three devoted regiments which
charged with Ligonier were the worst sufferers, the
Greys losing one hundred and sixty men, the Inniskillings
one hundred and twenty, and Cumberland's
dragoons nearly one hundred. The loss of the whole
of the Allies was about six thousand men, that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
French decidedly greater, amounting indeed, according
to Saxe's account, to not less than ten thousand men.
The British, moreover, had nine French colours and five
French standards as trophies for their consolation.
Finally, the French failed to accomplish the object of
the action, which was to cut off the Allies from
Maestricht.</p>

<p>After the battle the Allies crossed the Meuse and
encamped at Heer, a little to the east of Maestricht,
while Saxe returned to his quarters at Tongres. The
French then detached a corps for the capture of Bergen
op Zoom; but the most important transactions of the
war still went forward on the Meuse, where constant
negotiations were carried on between Saxe and Cumberland.
The campaign closed with the fall of Bergen op
Zoom and the capture of most of the strong places in
Dutch Brabant.</p>

<p>By this time King George and his people in
England were thoroughly sick of the war. The British
had suffered severely in every action, but had reaped no
success except in the fortunate victory of Dettingen.
The Dutch had proved themselves useless and contemptible
as Allies, their Government feeble and corrupt
in council, their troops unstable if not dangerous in
action. The Austrians, in spite of lavish subsidies, had
never furnished the troops that they had promised, and
had invariably obstructed operations through the obstinacy
of their Generals and the selfishness of their ends.
The opening of the campaign of 1748 was even more
unpromising for the Allies. Saxe, strong in the possession
of a superior force, kept Cumberland in suspense
between apprehensions for Breda and for Maestricht,
and when finally he laid siege to Maestricht could
match one hundred and fifteen thousand men against
Cumberland's five-and-thirty thousand. War on such
terms against such a master as Saxe was ridiculous.
Moreover, the Dutch, despite a recent revolution, were
more supine than ever; the Prince of Orange, who was
the new ruler, actually keeping two thousand of his troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
from the field that they might adorn the baptism of one
of his babies. In the face of such facts Cumberland
pressed earnestly for peace;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and on the 30th of April
preliminaries were signed, which six months later were
expanded into the definite treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>The peace left matters practically as they had stood
before the war, with the significant exception that
Frederick the Great retained Silesia. Not a word was
said as to the regulation of trade between England and
Spain, which had been the original ground of quarrel;
and as between England and France it was agreed that
there should be mutual restitution of all captures. Yet
this could not set the two countries in the same position
as before the war. The French were utterly exhausted;
but the British, though not a little harassed by the cost
of maintaining armies and producing subsidies, had
received a military training which was to stand them in
good stead for the great struggle that lay before them.
To understand this struggle aright it must first be seen
what was implied by the mutual restitution of all
captures, for among the possessions that had changed
hands during the war were Cape Breton and Madras.
The time is now come to watch the building up of
empire in distant lands to east and west. Let us turn
first to the great Peninsula of the East.</p>

<p class="noindent">As English history to the vast majority of Englishmen
begins with the Norman, so does also the modern
history of India begin with the Mohammedan, conquest.
As early as in the eighth century Arab conquerors made
incursions into Scinde as far as Hyderabad, only to be
driven back by a revolt of Hindoos; but it was not
until the eleventh century that Sultan Mahmoud, the
second of the House of Ghuznee, established a
Mohammedan garrison to the south of the Indus at
Lahore, nor until the end of the twelfth century that
Shahab-ud-din penetrated as far as Benares and fixed
the seat of government at Delhi. It was at his death
that India assumed the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'form of an independant'">form of an independent</ins> kingdom
distinct from the governments to the north of the
Indus; and it was only a few years later that the
invasion of the Moguls under Zinghis Khan heralded
the approach of the race that was first to gather the
greatest portion of the peninsula into a single empire,
and to found a dynasty which should rule it. The
battle of Delhi placed Baber, the first of this dynasty,
in possession of the capital, and set up therein the throne
of the Great Mogul. Baber's grandson, Akbar, after
fifty years of conquest, wise policy and incessant labour,
reduced the whole of Hindostan and great part of
the Deccan under the Mogul Empire, dividing it for
administrative purposes into eighteen provinces, each
under the rule of a governor or <em>subahdar</em>. But the
Deccan had never been firmly secured; and even after
the Hindoos had submitted there were Mohammedan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
chieftains who refused to acknowledge the supremacy
of the Moguls. Too jealous, however, to unite in resistance,
these chieftains allowed themselves to be crushed
in detail; and in 1656 the Emperor Shah Jehan seemed
to have established his authority over all the Mohammedan
kingdoms of the Deccan. But even so the work
of Shah Jehan did not endure. In the reign of his son
Aurungzebe a new power appeared to dispute the rule
of the Moguls in the Deccan. A race of Hindoo
mountaineers, the Mahrattas, came down from their
fastnesses in the Western Ghauts and hired themselves
out as mercenary soldiers to the Mohammedan chiefs.
Led by a man of genius, the famous Sevajee, the
Mahrattas grew continually in strength, and at length
fairly defeated the army of the Moguls in the open field.
It was not until after the death of Sevajee that
Aurungzebe was able to drive his followers back to the
hills, and push his Empire to its farthest limits to southward,
so far indeed as to include in it even a portion of
Mysore. Never before, it should seem, had so much of
the peninsula been united under the dominion of one
man; but the Mahrattas none the less had laid the axe
to the root of the Mogul Empire, and from the death
of Aurungzebe the tree, though destined to totter for
yet another fifty years, was already doomed. It must
now be told how the foundation of a new Indian Empire
fell not to the Mahrattas but to invaders from
Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1498.<br />1600,<br />Dec. 31.</div>

<p>The first of the European nations to gain a footing
in the peninsula was of course the Portuguese. In 1493
Bartholemew Diaz doubled the Cape of Good Hope,
and five years later Vasco da Gama arrived on the
Western or Malabar coast, and after a second voyage
obtained permission to establish a factory at Calicut.
His work was continued by Albuquerque, under whose
care the Portuguese power in India was more widely
extended than at any time before or since. To him it
was due that Goa was made the chief centre of Portuguese
influence, and that Ceylon became tributary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Portugal's king. It was not, however, conceivable that
Portugal should long be allowed to enjoy the monopoly
of this lucrative traffic; and competitors soon presented
themselves from the maritime powers of Europe.
Moreover, in 1580, Portugal passed under the crown of
Spain, so that any encroachment on her East Indian
trade inflicted also some damage on the detested
Spaniard. In 1582 an Englishman, Edward Fenton,
led the way by attempting a voyage direct to the east.
The venture, however, was a failure, as was also a second
attempt made by James Lancaster in 1589. Finally,
a Dutchman, James Houtmann, sailed from the Texel
in 1595, and presented himself as the first rival of
the Portuguese by the establishment of a factory
at Bantam in Java. But though thus distanced for a
moment in the race for a new market the English
speedily resolved to make up the lost ground; and in
1599 an association of Merchants Adventurers was
formed in London with the object of prosecuting a
voyage to the East Indies. In the following year they
received a charter from Queen Elizabeth, and thus came
into being the famous East India Company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1607.<br />1611.<br />1612.<br />1628.<br />1651.</div>

<p>The two first voyages of the new Company followed
the track of the Dutch to Sumatra and Java, but in the
third the ships were driven by stormy weather into
Sierra Leone, whence one of them under Captain
Hawkins sailed direct to Surat, and found there good
promise of opening trade. In 1609 Hawkins visited
Agra in person and obtained privileges from the reigning
Mogul, eldest son of the great Akbar; but his
influence was soon undermined by Portuguese Jesuits,
and he was fain to return with little profit. Two years
later, however, an English vessel touched at Point de
Galle, sailed up the Coromandel, or eastern, coast of India
as far as Masulipatam and founded the nucleus of a
factory at Petapolee, the germ from which was to spring
the trade of England in the Bay of Bengal. The
jealousy of Dutch and Portuguese had by this time
risen so high that the Company was obliged to employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
force against them. In 1612 Captain Best boldly
attacked a superior Portuguese fleet in the Bay of Surat,
and defeated it so thoroughly that the reigning Mogul
disallowed the Portuguese claim to a monopoly of the
trade, agreed to a treaty granting important privileges
to the English, and consented to receive an ambassador
from them at his Court. One formidable rival was thus
crippled, but the Dutch were not so easily to be dealt
with, more particularly since the troubles which followed
on the accession of Charles the First in England left
them little to fear from an armed force. The affairs of
the Company began to languish, but fresh outlets for
trade were none the less sought for. One factory was
definitely established at Masulipatam, a second on the
coast further northward, and finally, in 1640, a third was
settled at Madras under the name of Fort St. George.
This was the one gleam of sunshine at that period amid
all the troubles of England at home and abroad. Then
at last the cloud of the Civil War passed away; the
power of England began to revive, and the Company
addressed a <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'petition to Parliment'">petition to Parliament</ins> for redress of injuries
received from the Dutch. Thereupon followed the
Dutch war and the seven furious actions of Blake and
Monk, which dealt Dutch maritime ascendency a blow
from which it never recovered. A piece of unexpected
good fortune, namely the recovery of Shah Jehan's
daughter from dangerous sickness under the care of an
English surgeon at Surat, procured for the Company
free trade with Bengal. At the close of the Protectorate
the Company had organised its markets into three
divisions. A supreme presidency was established at
Surat with special charge of the Persian trade, a subordinate
presidency at Madras with control of the
factories on the eastern coast and in Bengal, and a
third presidency at Bantam for direction of the traffic
with the Eastern Islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1660.<br />1661.</div>

<p>Then came the Restoration, and with it a new
charter empowering the Company to send ships of war,
men, and arms to their factories for defence of the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and to make peace or war with any people not Christians.
Authority was also granted for the fortification of St.
Helena, which since 1651 had become the port of call
on the voyage to India, and stringent provision was
made for the maintenance of the Company's monopoly.
The following year brought Bombay by dowry to the
British Crown, and in 1662 Sir Abraham Shipman was
sent out with four hundred soldiers to take possession
and to remain as governor. These were the first
British troops to land in India, but as there was a dispute
with the Portuguese as to whether the word Bombay,
as inscribed in the treaty of marriage, signified the
island only or included its dependencies also, the poor
fellows were landed on the island of Anjediva, near Goa,
where they at once began to sicken. In 1664 they
were transferred to Madras, in view of the war with
Holland; but by the end of the year Shipman and a
vast number of the men were dead, and when at last
they landed in Bombay, in March 1665, the four
hundred had dwindled to one officer and one hundred
and thirteen men. Such was the first experience of the
British Army in India.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1668.</div>

<p>In 1668 Bombay, together with the whole of its
military stores, was made over to the Company for a
rent of ten pounds a year; and authority was also
given for the Company to enlist officers and men for
their own service, as well as to call in certain garrisons
of the King's troops at Bombay and Madras to fill up
vacancies. Further, in order to form a local militia,
half-pay was granted to all soldiers who would settle on
the island, new settlers were promised from England,
and a rule was made that not more than twenty soldiers
should return to Europe in any one year. The men
and officers of the King's troops at once took service
with the Company under its own military code and
articles of war, and thus was founded the first military
establishment in Bombay. The men agreed, it seems,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to serve for three years only, which gives them an
additional interest as the first English soldiers ever
enlisted for short service. Having thus provided itself
with men the Company proceeded next to the improvement
and fortification of Bombay itself, and with such
vigour that by 1674 no fewer than one hundred cannon
were mounted for its defence. Finally, in 1683-84 the
garrison was increased from four hundred to six hundred
men, two companies of Rajpoots were embodied as an
auxiliary force, and Bombay was made the headquarters
of the Company in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1685.</div>

<p>The Company thus strengthened forthwith became
ambitious. Hitherto it had addressed the native princes
in terms of humble submission: it now assumed the tone
of an equal and independent power, able to command
respect by force of arms. It also equipped a fleet of
twelve powerful men-of-war, which was first to capture
Chittagong and then to proceed up the eastern branch
of the Ganges to seize Dacca. Hostilities were precipitated
by a quarrel between English and native
soldiers in the bazaar at Hooghly, wherein the forces of
the nabob of the province were defeated. The nabob,
however, avenged himself by pouncing upon the British
factory at Patna; and the approach of Aurungzebe
caused the British to withdraw from Hooghly to
Chuttamuttee, the site of the present Calcutta. Thus
the war against the Moguls ended in the utter humiliation
of the Company. The period of conquest was
not yet come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1642.<br />1668.<br />1669.<br />1697.<br />1701.</div>

<p>Meanwhile a new rival had sprung up in the East
Indies. In 1609 a French East India Company had
been formed, which after thirty years of ineffectual life
at last gave definite evidence of vitality by the
formation of a settlement at Madagascar. The venture
was not a success; but the great minister Colbert,
quickly awake to the advantages of an Indian trade,
granted the help of the Government to form a new
Company, which, after wasting some time and money on
a second experiment in Madagascar, sent an expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to Surat. There in 1668 was established the first French
factory in India, which was quickly followed by the
erection of a second at Masulipatam. But, if the
Company were to prosper, something more than a
factory with a rival factory alongside it was needed;
and this want was made good by the foundation of
Pondicherry by François Martin in 1674. Two or
three years later a French fleet entered the Hooghly
and disembarked a body of settlers at Chandernagore,
which was finally granted to them by Aurungzebe in
1688. Meanwhile the foolish quarrel of the English
Company with the Moguls had given the French an
opportunity to take a share of the Indian trade, of
which they did not fail to make good use. Their
further progress was, however, checked for the moment
through the capture of Pondicherry by the Dutch in
1693; but the settlement was restored at the Peace of
Ryswick, and no time was lost in improving and fortifying
it. Shortly afterwards the French abandoned their
factory at Surat and transferred their headquarters to
Pondicherry. On the whole they had made good use
of their time. The settlements of the British Company
after one hundred years of existence were set down,
in contemporary spelling, as follows: Bombay, with
factories at Surat, Swally, Broach, Amadavad, Agra, and
Lucknow; on the Malabar coast the forts of Carwar,
Tellicherry, and Anjengo, with the factory of Calicut; on
the Coromandel coast Chinghee, Orixa, Fort St. George
or Madras, Fort St. David (which had been purchased
in 1692 as a counterpoise to Pondicherry), and the
factories of Cuddalore, Porto Novo, Petapolee, Masulipatam,
Madapollam, and Vizagapatam; in Bengal, Fort
William (Calcutta), with factories at Balasore, Cossimbazar,
Dacca, Hooghly, Moulda, Rajahmaul, and Patna.
The French could show Pondicherry, with a factory at
Masulipatam on the eastern coast, and Chandernagore
and Cossimbazar on the Hooghly as the result of barely
five-and-thirty years of work.</p>

<p>Such competition as this might not at first appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
formidable to the English, but the comparative strength
of the rival nations in India was not to be measured by
mere counting of forts and factories. François Martin
had shown considerable dexterity in handling the native
authorities during the negotiations by which he acquired
Pondicherry, and had established good traditions for the
management of similar business in future. All Frenchmen
had and still have a passion for interference with
the internal politics of any barbarous or semi-civilised
races with which they may be brought into contact, and
will spare no pains to gratify it. The emissaries of
the most insolent nation in Europe approached the
Indian princes with flattery of their self-esteem,
deference for their authority, respect for their prejudices,
conformity with their customs and imitation
of their habits; while the French love of dramatic
action and of display brought them at once into touch
with the oriental character. They gave sympathy,
sometimes in reality, always in appearance; and they
obtained in return not only toleration but friendship
and influence. Mere trading was sufficient for the
English; it was not so for the French. Their ambition
rose above the mere bartering of goods to the governing
of men and the swaying of them by subtle policy to the
glory of France. It was no ignoble aim, and might well
lead to the making, if not to the keeping, of an Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707.<br />1719.</div>

<p>Aurungzebe at his death divided his dominions
among his three sons, who at once fell to fighting for
the succession to the entire realm. The contest was
decided after a year in favour of the eldest of them,
Bahadur Shah, who hastened to make terms with the
Mahrattas in the south, but secured a precarious peace
in that quarter only to find himself confronted with an
insurrection of Rajpoots and with the sudden and
alarming rise of the Sikhs in the Punjaub. He died in
1712, when the succession after the inevitable dispute
passed to his grandson Farokshir, who succeeded in
crushing the Sikhs but made little head against the
Mahrattas, whose territory continued to increase in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
south. Finally, on Farokshir's death in 1719 Nizam-ul-Mulk,
the Governor of Malwa, rose in revolt against
his successor, made terms with the Mahrattas, and was
soon virtually master of the Deccan; to which, after
a short-lived reconciliation with the Court of Delhi, he
returned in 1724, openly and avowedly as an independent
monarch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1725.<br />1735.</div>

<p>During this period the English Company acquired
from Farokshir an extension of territory on the
Hooghly, amounting to a tract of nearly ten miles on
both sides of the river. The French, on the other
hand, were declining owing to the virtual insolvency
of the Company; nor was it until 1723, five years
after the reconstruction of a new Company, that their
prospects in India began to revive. But already, in
1720, a man had been appointed to high station in
Pondicherry who was destined to raise French influence
in India to a height undreamed of by friend or foe.
This was Joseph François Dupleix, son of a director of
the French East India Company, who, though in boyhood
averse to a mercantile life, had been converted
by travel at sea to a passion for commercial enterprise
and to a longing for a field wherein to indulge it. Such
a field was now opened to him, when no more than
twenty-three years of age, in India. His idea was to
extend the operations of the Company beyond the mere
trade between Europe and Pondicherry, and, by opening
up traffic with the cities both inland and on the coast,
to make Pondicherry the centre of the commerce of
Southern India. To show, by example, that such a
scheme was feasible, he embarked his own fortune in
the trade and made a handsome profit. In 1731 he
was sent to Chandernagore, then fast sinking into
stagnation and decay, and by his energy soon raised it
to the most important European centre in Bengal.
Concurrently a second great Frenchman, who was also
to leave his mark on India, had made his appearance in
1725. The occasion was the capture of Mahé, a little
town on the western coast, where the French desired a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
port to compensate them for the abandonment of Surat.
The feat was accomplished by a captain in the French
navy named Bertrand de la Bourdonnais. His next
duty, though not performed in India, was none the less
of high importance to it, namely the improvement of
the island of Mauritius. The French attempts at
colonisation in Madagascar had been foiled alike by the
climate and by the hostility of the natives; and the
settlers had perforce betaken themselves to the adjacent
island of Bourbon. La Bourdonnais found Mauritius
a mere forest, yet within two years he converted it
into a flourishing settlement, well cultivated and well
administered, with arsenals, magazines, barracks,
fortifications, dockyards, and all that was necessary to
make it not only a commercial station but a base for
military operations in India.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the confusion that accompanied the
gradual dissolution of the Mogul Empire was turned to
useful account by yet another Frenchman, Dumas, the
Governor of Pondicherry. In 1732 the Nabob of the
Carnatic died and was succeeded by his nephew Dost
Ali, who however was on such ill terms with his
superior, the viceroy Nizam-ul-Mulk of the Deccan,
that he could not obtain from him authentic confirmation
of his succession. He therefore courted the support
of the Governor of Pondicherry, conceding to him
substantial privileges in return, and soon formed
intimate relations with him. Dost Ali, moreover, had
a son, Sufder Ali, and two sons-in-law, Mortiz Ali and
Chunda Sahib, of whom the last named was imbued
with a particular admiration for the French. The
extension of French influence through these new friendships
advanced rapidly. In 1735 the death of the
Hindoo Rajah of Trichinopoly was followed, as usual,
by a quarrel over the succession. The widow of the
Rajah, who was one of the claimants, took the fatal step
of invoking the help of Dost Ali, who sent Chunda
Sahib with an army to her assistance. Chunda Sahib,
however, once admitted to the city refused to leave it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
but assumed the government in the name of Dost Ali;
and thus Trichinopoly passed into the hands of a friend
to the French. Adjoining Trichinopoly and between
it and the eastern coast lay the Hindoo kingdom
of Tanjore; the Coleroon river, which formed its
northern boundary, running within thirty miles of
Pondicherry. Here again the death of the Rajah in
1738 led to a dispute over the succession, and one of the
competitors, named Sauhojee, offered Governor Dumas
the town of Carical in the delta of the Cauvery and
Coleroon, as the price of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'French assistancee'">French assistance</ins>. Dumas
promptly supplied money, arms, and ammunition; and
when Sauhojee, having thus gained his kingdom,
declined to fulfil his agreement, Chunda Sahib stepped
in unasked to compel him. Thus Carical also was
added to the French settlements in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739.<br />1740.<br />1741,<br />March.</div>

<p>But now the Mahrattas, jealous of the advance of
the Mohammedans in the south, gathered themselves
together for the conquest of the Carnatic, defeated and
killed Dost Ali, and spread panic from end to end of
the province. Sufder Ali, thus become Nabob, and
Chunda Sahib fell back on their French allies and sent
their families and goods for security to Pondicherry.
Dumas gave them asylum without hesitation, nor could
all the threats of the Mahrattas shake his loyalty to his
friends. He answered their menaces by strengthening
the defences of the town, formed a body of European
infantry, and by a happy inspiration armed four or five
thousand Mohammedan natives and trained and drilled
them after the European model. Thus was conceived
in danger and emergency the embryo, now grown to
such mighty manhood, of a Sepoy Army. Meanwhile
Sufder Ali, after the Oriental manner, succeeded in
purchasing immunity from the Mahrattas by secretly
betraying Chunda Sahib into their hands; but none the
less his gratitude to the French was extreme. He
declared that from henceforth they should be as much
masters of the Carnatic as himself, and granted to them
additional territory on the southern bounds of Pondicherry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
The Mahrattas, pursuant to their agreement
with Sufder Ali, then beleaguered Chunda Sahib in
Trichinopoly, captured the city after a siege of three
months, and carried him off as their prisoner. This
done they turned again upon Dumas, and required of
him, among other demands, the surrender of Chunda
Sahib's property. Dumas received the Mahratta envoy
with courtesy but refused inflexibly to comply; and
having shown him the preparations which he had
made for the defence of Pondicherry he dismissed him
with the assurance that he would stand by the city so
long as a man was left with him. This resolute bearing
had its effect. The further wrath of the Mahratta
chief was allayed by a present of French liqueurs; and
the danger passed away. Dumas, as the man who had
defied the dreaded Mahrattas, became the hero of
Southern India. Presents and eulogies were showered
on him by Sufder Ali and Nizam-ul-Mulk; and even
the effete Mogul Emperor at Delhi conferred on him
the title of Nabob, adding thereto the favour, conferred
at Dumas's own request, that the rank should descend
to his successor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct.</div>

<p>Dumas then resigned and returned to France,
leaving Dupleix to reign in his stead. The latter, after
ten years' administration of Chandernagore, had raised
it to the head of the European settlements in Bengal,
and had concurrently amassed for himself an enormous
fortune by private trading. He at once assumed all
the pomp and circumstance of his rank of Nabob,
caused himself to be installed with great ceremony at
Chandernagore, and took pains to impress upon the
neighbouring princes that he was one of themselves and
armed with like authority from the court of Delhi.
He could wear the dignity of his position the more
naturally since he had an innate passion for display, and
could turn the outward glitter to the better account for
that he loved it for its own sake. But his was no
spirit to be content with the mere robes of royalty.
The weakness of the court of Delhi and his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
remoteness from it left him free from all restraint. He
had the power, and he knew how to use it; and it
had come to him in the nick of time, when hostilities
between France and England were hastening to their
development into avowed and open war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742,<br />Sept.<br />1744.</div>

<p>But meanwhile native affairs had undergone their
usual swift changes in the Carnatic. Sufder Ali, once
established as Nabob, refused to pay the revenue due
from him to the viceroy Nizam-ul-Mulk, and, having
little hope of French support in such defiance of
authority, transferred his treasures from Pondicherry to
the custody of the English at Madras. Shortly afterwards
he was assassinated by his brother-in-law, Mortiz
Ali, who thereupon proclaimed himself Nabob. His
principal officers then appealed to the Mahratta chief,
Morari Rao, to drive him out, and Mortiz Ali fled,
leaving Sufder Ali's infant son to reign in his place.
The whole province fell into anarchy, and in 1743 the
viceroy Nizam-ul-Mulk appeared with a large army to
restore order. The Mahrattas therefore retired from
Trichinopoly; and, the infant ruler having been made
away with, Anwarudeen, one of the viceroy's officers,
was installed as Nabob. By this time Dupleix had
received intelligence that war had been declared between
France and England, and that a British squadron was
on its way to destroy Pondicherry. The French
squadron in East Indian waters had been recalled to
France; the fortifications of the city were open to
destruction by the cannon of men-of-war; and there
were less than five hundred Europeans in garrison to
defend it against a joint attack by sea and land. At this
crisis Dupleix appealed to Anwarudeen for protection,
pleading the friendship of the French with the Nabobs
of the Carnatic in the past. The Nabob responded by
sending a message to Madras that he intended to
enforce strict neutrality within his province, and would
permit no attack to be made on the French possessions
on the coast of Coromandel.</p>

<p>At the close of 1745 the British squadron duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
arrived, but found itself, through Anwarudeen's action,
limited exclusively to operations by sea. Meanwhile,
also La Bourdonnais, aided partly by the arrival of a
few weak ships from France, but chiefly by his own
amazing energy and resource, had fitted out a squadron
at Mauritius, with which he appeared in July 1746 off
the southern coast of Ceylon. An indecisive engagement
followed, at the close of which the British
commander, Commodore Peyton, with strange pusillanimity
sailed to Trincomalee to repair the trifling
damage sustained in the action, leaving Pondicherry
untouched and Madras unprotected from French
attack. The French therefore had won a first and
most important point in the game: if the Nabob could
be persuaded to let that game proceed without
interference, the ultimate victory must lie with France.</p>

<p>The town of Madras at that time consisted of three
divisions; that on the south side, which was known as
the White Town or Fort St. George, being inhabited by
Europeans, that next to northward of it being given
up to the wealthier class of Indian and Armenian
merchants, while a suburb to the north of all was filled
with all other classes of natives. Of these divisions the
White Town, which was about four hundred yards long
by one hundred broad, alone possessed defences worthy
the name, being surrounded by a slender wall with four
bastions and as many batteries. The total number of
English did not exceed three hundred, two-thirds of
which was made up of the soldiers of the garrison.
The Directors of the East India Company had too often
been neglectful of defences in the past, and had improved
little in this respect during the past half century.
They relied upon the British fleet and upon that alone.
The Governor, Mr. Morse, was simply a merchant, a
man of invoices and ledgers, with little knowledge of
affairs beyond the scope of his business, and ignorant of
the very alphabet of intercourse with native princes.
There was, it is true, a clerk in his office named Robert
Clive, who had arrived in India two years before; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
this clerk was known only as a quiet, friendless lad,
not without spirit when provoked, but lonely and out of
harmony with his environment, and grateful to be able
to escape from it to the refuge of the Governor's
library. On receiving intelligence of hostile preparations
by the French at Pondicherry, Governor Morse appealed
to the Nabob Anwarudeen to fulfil his determination of
enforcing neutrality within the Carnatic; but his envoy,
being unprovided with the indispensable credentials of
a present, met with little success in his mission. On
the 29th of August the French squadron appeared
before Madras, cannonaded it for a time with little
effect and sailed away again; but a fortnight later it
reappeared with eleven hundred European soldiers and
four hundred drilled natives, under the command of La
Bourdonnais in person. The troops were at once
landed, batteries were erected, and after a short bombardment
Madras was forced to capitulate. The terms agreed
on were, that all the English inhabitants should be
prisoners on parole, and that negotiations might be
reopened later for ransom of the town.</p>

<p>The Nabob Anwarudeen no sooner heard that the
French were actually besieging Madras than he sent a
message to Dupleix that unless further operations were
suspended he would put an end to them by force.
Dupleix answered astutely that he was conquering the
town not for France but for the Nabob himself, and
would deliver it to him immediately on its surrender.
Fortunately for England La Bourdonnais's views as to
the future treatment of Madras differed materially from
those of Dupleix. As conqueror of the settlement he
claimed that the ultimate disposal of it lay with himself:
Dupleix, intent above all things on conciliating the
Nabob, as vehemently contended that his authority as
Governor-General was supreme in such matters. The
two masterful men fell bitterly at variance over the
question, and lost sight of all greater interests in the
acrimony of their quarrel. La Bourdonnais, fully aware
of the danger of waiting on the coast when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
northern monsoon was due, but bent none the less on
having his own way, lingered on and on before Madras,
until on the 14th of October the monsoon suddenly
burst upon him with the force of a hurricane, destroyed
four of his eight ships utterly, and disabled the remainder.
A week later he signed a treaty for the
ransom of Madras and for its subsequent evacuation by
the French; and this done he returned, as soon as his
ships could be made seaworthy, to Pondicherry. There
the quarrel with Dupleix was resumed face to face; and
after only ten days' stay La Bourdonnais sailed from
India never to return.</p>

<p>Dupleix was now left in sole and unhampered
command, with moreover a force of three thousand
trained Europeans ready to his hand, some of them left
behind by La Bourdonnais, some taken from the
French squadron. Such an accession of strength was
all important to him, for he had now to reckon with
the Nabob, who growing suspicious over the long delay
in the delivery of Madras had sent ten thousand men
under his son Maphuze Khan to invest the town.
Dupleix, who, if he had ever meant to give it up, had
determined first to dismantle the fortifications, sent
orders to D'Espréménil, the officer in command, to hold
the town at all hazards. D'Espréménil finding himself
hard pressed made a sortie with four hundred of his
garrison, and boldly facing the masses of the enemy's
cavalry opened on them so effective a fire from his field-guns
that they fled with precipitation, abandoning
their camp to the victor. With their own clumsy
artillery, not yet advanced beyond the stage attained by
European nations in the sixteenth century, the natives
thought it good practice if a gun were discharged
four times in an hour; and they were utterly confounded
and dismayed by the rapidity with which the
French pieces were served. This was one great lesson
for Europeans in Indian warfare, but a second and a
greater was to follow. After lingering for another day
in the vicinity of Madras Maphuze marched to St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Thomé, some four miles to southward of it, to intercept
a French force which was on its way to relieve
D'Espréménil's garrison. On the morning of the 4th
of November the expected detachment appeared, a
mere handful of two hundred and thirty Europeans and
seven hundred Sepoys, which had been sent up from
Pondicherry under a Swiss officer named Paradis. The
situation of Paradis was sufficiently perilous to have
alarmed him. His orders were to open communications
with Madras; and here was an army of ten
thousand men, with artillery, drawn up on the bank of
a river before him to bar his advance. Now, after a
century and a half of fighting in India, no British
officer would be for a moment at a loss as to the
course to be pursued, but Paradis had neither tradition
nor experience to guide him. However, whether by
inspiration or from despair, he did exactly what he
ought. Knowing the river to be fordable, he led his
men without hesitation across it and straight upon the
enemy, scrambled up the bank, gave them one volley,
and charged with the bayonet. The effect of this bold
attack was instantaneous. The Nabob's army was at
once transformed into a disorganised mob, which fled
headlong into the town of St. Thomé, only to be
crowded and jammed in hopeless confusion in the
streets. Paradis, following up his success, poured volley
after volley into the struggling mass; while, to perfect
the victory, a party which had been detached from
Madras to join hands with him came up in rear of the
fugitives and cut off their retreat. This attack in rear,
always dreaded by Oriental nations, completed the rout.
Maphuze Khan, who was mounted on an elephant, was
one of the first to fly; and his army streamed away to
westward, a helpless, terrified rabble, never pausing in
its flight until it reached Arcot.</p>

<p>With this action it may be said that the dominance
of an European nation in India was assured. Hitherto
the native armies had been treated with respect. Their
numbers had given the impression of overwhelming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
strength; and it had not occurred to Europeans that
they could be encountered except with a force of man
for man. Consequently all dealings of Europeans with
native princes had been conducted in a spirit of humility
and awe. Even Dupleix, while flaunting his dignity
among his brother Nabobs, had courted the ruler of the
Carnatic with deference and submission. Now the spell
was broken, and Dupleix from the courtier had become
the master; so momentous was the change wrought by a
single Swiss officer, whose very name is hardly known to
the nation which now rules India. Of all the fruits of
the long friendship which French and Swiss sealed with
each other's blood in the furious struggle of Marignano,
none is more remarkable than this. The memory of
Paradis should be honoured in England since he taught
us the secret of the conquest of India.</p>

  <span class="blka">6</span>
  <span class="blka over">17</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>The victory swept away Dupleix's principal difficulties
at a blow. He at once appointed Paradis to the
chief command at Madras and bade him issue a manifesto
repudiating La Bourdonnais's treaty as null and
void, and declaring Madras to belong to the French by
right of conquest. The English protested, but in vain.
Morse and the rest of the officials were conducted to
Pondicherry. A few only contrived to make their
escape to Fort St. David, among them the man who
was soon to make Dupleix smart for his ill-faith, the
young writer Robert Clive. Fort St. David, situate
about twelve miles south of Pondicherry, now became
the rallying-point of the English. Since the fall of
Madras the authorities there had taken over the general
administration of British affairs on the coast of Coromandel;
the fort, though small, was the strongest for its
size that the British possessed in India; and they were
determined to defend it to the last extremity. Dupleix
on his side was equally resolved to strike at it without
delay, and with this object he instructed Paradis to
return to Pondicherry as soon as he should have settled
the affairs of Madras. This duty, however, detained
Paradis until December; and meanwhile the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
officials had invoked the aid of the Nabob Anwarudeen,
who, smarting under the defeat of St. Thomé, agreed to
send a force under Maphuze Khan and his brother
Mohammed Ali to Fort St. David. Maphuze Khan,
eager to wipe out his disgrace, attacked Paradis on his
march down from Madras; but the French, though
they were but three hundred strong and encumbered
with the plunder of Madras, beat off his attack with
little difficulty, and made their way, with trifling loss,
to their destination of Ariancopang, a mile and a half
from Pondicherry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">

</span>.<br />
1747.<br />Feb.</div>

<p>The total force now gathered together by Dupleix
at Ariancopang for the attack on Fort St. David consisted
of about sixteen hundred men, nine hundred of
them Europeans, with six field-pieces and as many
mortars. Against these the British garrison could
muster but two hundred Europeans and half as many
natives. Unluckily, however, for the success of Dupleix's
schemes, there were several French officers senior
to Paradis, the chief of whom, General de Bury, took
the command. On the 19th of December De Bury
crossed the river Pennar and encamped in a walled garden
about a mile and a half from Fort St. David. Though
the Nabob's army was not five miles distant, neither
picquets nor sentries were posted; and the French were
dispersed and cooking their dinners when they were
suddenly alarmed by the approach of the enemy. Panic-stricken
the whole force rushed out of the garden to the
river, each man anxious only to place the water between
himself and the foe; and had not the artillery stood
firm De Bury's troops would have fared badly indeed.
As things fell out they escaped with the loss of a dozen
Europeans killed and one hundred and twenty wounded,
and made good their retreat to Ariancopang. For three
weeks after this reverse the French remained inactive
in their camp, but in January 1747 a squadron of
French ships arrived on the coast, and Dupleix seized
the opportunity offered by this display of force to
reopen negotiations with the Nabob Anwarudeen. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
his usual dexterity he pointed out that the condition of
the British was hopeless; and his arguments were not
the less cogent for an accompaniment of gifts to the
value of fifteen thousand pounds. The Nabob, already
weary of the war, concluded a peace with the French
and withdrew his army from Fort St. David.</p>

<p>Dupleix seemed now to hold his rivals in his hand;
and undoubtedly for the moment the outlook for the
British was dark. One or two isolated ships despatched
by the Company had arrived on the coast, but had
either been captured or frightened away; and it was
not until March that one of them succeeded in landing
twenty men and sixty thousand pounds in silver at Fort
St. David. Ten days later the French began a second
attempt against the fort, but were compelled to
beat a hasty retreat by the arrival of Admiral Griffin with
a British squadron in the roadstead. Griffin landed a
company of one hundred soldiers, and lent also marines
and sailors from the fleet, as a temporary measure, to
strengthen the garrison while he sailed with the fleet to
blockade Pondicherry. Fresh reinforcements arrived
at Fort St. David both from Europe and from some of
the Company's settlements during May and June; and
by July the garrison, including the naval brigade, had
risen to twelve hundred Europeans and eight hundred
natives.</p>

1748.</div>

<p>The restoration of British supremacy at sea turned
the tables against Dupleix, but he contrived none the
less to despatch a message to Mauritius for reinforcements.
The letter did not reach the island until
December, nor was it possible until May 1748 to send
off a squadron, which even then was inferior in strength
to the blockading fleet under Griffin. By great dexterity,
however, the French Admiral contrived to
entice Griffin to sea and to slip past him in the night
to Madras, where having landed three hundred European
soldiers and a large sum of money he put to sea
again, leaving Griffin to hunt for him where he would.
Dupleix thereupon snatched the opportunity afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
by Griffin's absence to make an attack on Cuddalore, an
English fortified station about two miles south of Fort
St. David, which he had already attempted once without
success. The force that he had collected for this enterprise
was large judged by the minute scale of the
armies employed in these early Indian wars, consisting
of eight hundred Europeans and one thousand Sepoys.
But by this time the British had been strengthened not
only by the reinforcements of the previous year but
by the arrival in January of a competent commander.
This officer, whose fame is far below his deserts, was
Major Stringer Lawrence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
June <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">17</span>
  <span class="blka over">28</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>Dupleix's idea was to surprise Cuddalore by night,
and with this view he sent his army by a circuitous
route to some hills within three miles of the station,
with orders to halt and remain concealed until the time
should come for the attack. Lawrence, who had full
intelligence of the design, ostentatiously removed the
garrison and the guns from Cuddalore to Fort St. David
during the day; but at nightfall sent them back again,
with due precautions to conceal the fact from the
French, together with a reinforcement of four hundred
Europeans. At midnight the French advanced to the
walls without thought of meeting with resistance, but
had no sooner planted their scaling-ladders than they
were saluted by a withering fire of musketry and grape.
The whole body was instantly smitten with panic. Most
of them flung down their arms without firing a shot,
and one and all took to their heels and fled, not halting
until they reached Pondicherry. So ended the first
brush between French and English troops in India.</p>

<p>The result was a sad blow to Dupleix, for news had
reached them that a powerful armament was on its way
from England. In effect the British Government had
determined to help the East India Company both with
ships and men, and in November 1747 Admiral Boscawen
had sailed with eight men-of-war and a convoy of fourteen
hundred regular troops. By a novel arrangement,
due doubtless to the sad experience of Carthagena, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Admiral held sole command both of army and navy.
The first object prescribed to the expedition was the
capture of Mauritius and Bourbon, which islands, being
within a month's sail of the coast of Coromandel, were
of unspeakable value to the French as a base for their
operations in India. The British possessed no such
station. St. Helena was too remote, even supposing
that a harbour comparable to Port Louis could have been
found in it, and the Cape of Good Hope was in the hands
of the Dutch. Boscawen arrived before Port Louis on
the 4th of July, but found Mauritius strongly defended
by forts and batteries at every spot which was suitable
for a landing. After three days spent in vain endeavour
to discover a weak point, the Admiral decided to
push on without further loss of time to the ulterior goal
appointed him by his instructions, Pondicherry. He
set sail, therefore, for Fort St. David, and early in
August effected his junction with Griffin. The combined
squadrons formed the most powerful armament
yet seen in East Indian waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Aug. <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">8</span>
  <span class="blka over">19</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>A fleet of thirty ships set Boscawen at ease as to his
communications by sea; and as every preparation had
been made at Fort St. David against his arrival, he was
able within a week to march to the siege of Pondicherry.
The King's regular troops consisted of twelve independent
companies each one hundred strong, eight
hundred marines, and eighty of the Royal Artillery,
which, added to the Company's soldiers and a naval
brigade, brought up the total to a strength of thirty-seven
hundred Europeans. Two thousand Sepoys also
accompanied the expedition, though as yet neither
trained nor disciplined. But meanwhile Dupleix had
not been idle. Desperate though his situation might
appear, he had resolved to make the best of it, and had
not only strengthened the defences of Pondicherry itself,
but had added a strong fort at Ariancopang, which was
constructed under the care of the indefatigable Paradis.
This latter work was the first obstacle that presented
itself to Boscawen's advance. No one in his camp knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
anything about it, because no one had been at any pains
to find out. A deserter reported that it was held by a
hundred natives only, and Boscawen without further
ado resolved to carry it by storm. Seven hundred men
were therefore launched against it, only to find that the
defences were decidedly formidable and the garrison
four times as strong as had been supposed. Moreover,
owing to a neglect which, after the failure before St.
Lazaro, seems perfectly unpardonable, no scaling-ladders
had been prepared for the storming party. The troops,
therefore, as at St. Lazaro, tried stubbornly to do
impossibilities until nearly a fourth of their number had
been killed or wounded, and then fell back not less
mortified than dispirited by their repulse.</p>

</span></div>

<p>It was then resolved to besiege Ariancopang in form;
but here as at Carthagena the engineers proved to be
utterly ignorant of their business, and blunder succeeded
blunder. Paradis, who had a troop of sixty horse in
addition to the infantry of his garrison, judged astutely
of the moral effect which cavalry might produce on
seafaring men, and sent his handful of troopers, with
infantry in support, straight at the trenches of the naval
brigade. The sailors were seized with panic; the panic
spread to the regular troops, and the whole rushed
headlong back to the camp, leaving their best officer,
Stringer Lawrence, to be taken prisoner. Accident,
however, came to the help of the British. A magazine
at Ariancopang caught fire and exploded, disabling over
one hundred men; and the garrison having dismantled
the fortifications withdrew into Pondicherry. Boscawen
accordingly moved forward from Ariancopang and
opened his trenches against the north-western corner of
the town. Then once more the ignorance of the
engineers led to blunders and waste of time, for they
opened their first parallel at a distance of fifteen hundred
yards, or twice the distance prescribed by rule and
common sense, from the covered way. Still fortune
for the present favoured the British. A sortie made by
the French was brilliantly repulsed, and Paradis, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
ablest of the French both as officer and engineer, was
wounded to the death. The Englishman most distinguished
in this affair was to prove himself Paradis's
most brilliant pupil, an ensign in the Company's service,
taken only twelve months before as a clerk from the
Company's desks, Robert Clive.</p>

<p>The success of the British now appeared so certain
that the Nabob Anwarudeen, yielding to the repeated
gifts and appeals of Boscawen, decided to throw in his
lot with them and promised to furnish a body of two
thousand horse. Still Dupleix was not discouraged.
By the death of Paradis the chief burden of military as
well as of civil command was thrown upon his shoulders,
but he did not shrink from it. After all, if he were
no soldier, neither was Boscawen. By immense labour
the British trenches were carried forward to the position
from which they should have been opened, eight
hundred yards from the wall, and early in October two
batteries at last opened on the town. They were
answered by twice as formidable a fire from the guns
of the besieged. Boscawen then ordered the fleet to
open fire from the sea, but the ships being prevented
by shoal water from approaching nearer than a thousand
yards from the works, the cannonade was wholly
ineffective. The fire of the British batteries ashore
continued for three days with little result, while that
of the besieged increased rather than languished. The
rainy season then set in earlier than usual; the trenches
were flooded, and disease began to rage in the British
camp. Finally, on the 11th of October, Boscawen
decided to raise the siege and the British retreated,
leaving over one thousand Europeans dead behind
them, while Dupleix remained proud and unconquered
in Pondicherry.</p>

<p>The failure of this enterprise was due to the same
causes that had wrecked the expedition to Carthagena.
In the first place, Boscawen arrived on the coast too
late. In the second, he wasted nearly three weeks
over the capture of Ariancopang, which was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
essential to the capture of Pondicherry. In the third,
the unskilfulness of the engineers prolonged the
operations, and occupied the troops with duties which
kept them from active service in the trenches and
harassed them to death for no purpose. The experiment
of setting a naval officer in charge of highly
technical military operations was probably due to the
influence of Vernon; to which also may be traced
Boscawen's readiness to attempt the storm of Ariancopang
after Vernon's rough-and-ready manner. Against
Spaniards in South America such methods might have
succeeded; against Frenchmen they could not, least of
all when commanded by a Dupleix with a Paradis for
his military adviser. If the failure before Pondicherry
had ended with the raising of the siege, the reverse
would have been comparatively a trifling matter; but
it told far and wide over India as a blow to British
influence and prestige, and Dupleix was not the man to
neglect to magnify the success and the greatness of his
nation.</p>

<p>The news of the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle some
months later brought about a cessation of overt
hostilities and the re-delivery of Madras to Boscawen;
but still the war did not end. As in Europe French
and English could fight fiercely as auxiliaries of an
Elector of Bavaria and a Queen of Hungary, so in
Asia they could carry on, as allies of native princes,
the contest which was to determine the fate of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749.</div>

<p class="noindent">The first of the native states in which the British
initiated their new policy of intervention was one with
which the French had busied themselves ten years
earlier, the kingdom of Tanjore. There the ruler
favoured by Governor Dumas, Sauhojee, had, after
some years of misrule, been deposed; he now came to
the British Company for assistance, offering to pay the
expenses of the war and to give the fort and territory
of Devicotah as the price of his re-establishment on the
throne. The Company accordingly detailed a force of
five hundred Europeans and fifteen hundred Sepoys,
which started at the end of March 1749 for <ins class="corr" title="Errata&mdash;Original text: 'Trichinopoly, the capital of Tanjore.'">Trichinopoly.</ins>
Sauhojee had engaged
that its operations could be seconded by a general
rising in his favour, but this promise was found to be
illusory, and the expedition returned without effecting
anything. Undismayed, however, by this first failure,
the Company equipped a second force, and resolved
this time to push straight for the prize offered by
Sauhojee, the fort of Devicotah. Eight hundred
Europeans and fifteen hundred Sepoys under command
of Major Stringer Lawrence embarked for the mouth
of the Coleroon, and landing on the south side of the
river succeeded after a few days' cannonade in battering
a breach in the wall of the fort. A ship's carpenter
then contrived a raft on which troops could be conveyed
across the river, and Lawrence resolved to storm the
fort forthwith. Clive led the storming party, which
consisted of thirty-four Europeans and seven hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Sepoys, but, the Sepoys failing to support him, his
little party of British was cut to pieces by the cavalry
of the Tanjorines, and he himself narrowly escaped
with his life. Lawrence thereupon resolved to throw
the whole of his Europeans into the breach. The
Tanjorine horse again attacked them as they advanced,
but were crushed by their fire; and the British on
entering the breach found the fort deserted. Lawrence
accordingly took possession of the fort and territory,
and the Company, having obtained all that it desired,
promised Sauhojee a pension if he would undertake to
give no more trouble in Tanjore. It was destined to
pay dearly for this evil precedent, and for the paltry
acquisition so ignobly gained.</p>

<p>Meanwhile momentous events elsewhere had led
to fresh complications. In 1748 Nizam-ul-Mulk, the
Viceroy of the Deccan, died, and his death was followed
as usual by a quarrel over the succession to his throne.
The successor nominated by the dead ruler was his
grandson, Murzapha Jung; the rival was his second
son, Nasir Jung; and, as was natural, both claimants
cast about them for allies. It has already been related
how Chunda Sahib, the devoted admirer of the French,
had been captured by the Mahrattas in Trichinopoly
in 1741. Ever since that time he had been kept in
close confinement at Satara; the Mahrattas, who knew
him by reputation as the ablest soldier that had been
seen for years in the Carnatic, refusing to release him
except for an impossible ransom. He had, however, a
friend in Dupleix, who throughout his imprisonment
had protected his wife and family in Pondicherry, and
had contrived further to maintain with him a friendly
correspondence. Murzapha Jung while travelling in
search of help from the Mahrattas encountered Chunda
Sahib at Satara, and at once perceived the value of such
a man for an ally. Dupleix was called in, and took in
the whole situation at a glance. If the force of the
French arms could enthrone Murzapha Jung as viceroy,
there would be little or nothing to hinder French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
influence from becoming predominant in the Deccan,
or, in other words, to prevent Dupleix from becoming
practically if not nominally viceroy himself. He at
once pledged himself to discharge Chunda Sahib's
ransom, and immediately after his release allowed him
to take into his pay two thousand Sepoys from the
garrison of Pondicherry; agreeing also, on receipt of
a further cession of territory near the town, to give him
the assistance of four hundred European soldiers.
With these and with the troops that he had collected,
in all some six thousand men, Chunda Sahib joined
himself to Murzapha Jung's army of thirty thousand
men, and advanced with them against Arcot. The
capture of this, the capital town of the Carnatic, would
place the resources of that province at their disposal
and win for them the first step to the throne of the
Deccan. The old Nabob Anwarudeen had collected
a force to oppose them, but he could bring forward no
troops to match the disciplined infantry of the French.
After a sharp action at Amoor he was defeated and
slain: the victorious army entered Arcot on the following
day, and the Carnatic was won.</p>

<p>Murzapha Jung having proclaimed himself Viceroy
of the Deccan, and taken steps to assert his sovereignty,
proceeded next with Chunda Sahib to Pondicherry,
where they were received in great state by Dupleix, and
in return rewarded him with yet another grant of the
neighbouring territory. Meanwhile the English looked
on, indignant but helpless, having barred their right
to protest by their own foolish action at Tanjore.
Boscawen did indeed take advantage of Anwarudeen's
death to hoist the British flag over St. Thomé, as a
masterless town which might be of profit to the
Company; but for the rest the arm of the British
seemed paralysed. Mohammed Ali, son of the dead
Nabob Anwarudeen, who had fled from the field of
Amoor to Trichinopoly, invoked the aid of the East
India Company; but though profoundly distrustful of
the friendship between Chunda Sahib and Dupleix, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
authorities sent but one hundred and twenty men to
help him. This done, they actually permitted Boscawen
to return to England with his fleet and transports,
retaining but three hundred of his men in India to
strengthen the British garrison. This was the moment
for which Dupleix had longed. The one force which
he dreaded was removed. It remained only for
Murzapha Jung and Chunda Sahib to march to
Trichinopoly and crush Mohammed Ali; and <ins class="corr" title="Errata&mdash;Original text: 'Deccan'">Southern India</ins>
was gained once for all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">

<p>Dupleix did not fail to urge this step upon his two
allies; but they had spent so much money over their
own enjoyment at Pondicherry that they had exhausted
the treasure necessary for the decisive campaign.
Judging that the easiest and speediest method of
replenishing their empty purse would be to extort
funds from the Rajah of Tanjore, they led their armies
against that city and summoned it to surrender. The
Rajah, Partab Singh, gained time by astute negotiation
to summon the English and Murzapha Jung's rival,
Nasir Jung, to his assistance; but the English hardly
responded, and the Rajah, cowed by an attack of the
French infantry on the defences of the city, agreed to
pay the sum required of him. None the less, by
continual haggling he continued to keep his enemies
inactive before the walls until the news of Nasir Jung's
approach, with a force of overwhelming strength, caused
them to fall back in panic upon Pondicherry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
1750.<br />
April <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1</span>
  <span class="blka over">12</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>The favourable moment in fact had been lost,
despite Dupleix's pressing entreaties that it might be
seized. Nasir Jung had not only invaded the Carnatic
with his own forces but had called Mohammed Ali and
the British to his standard; and the East India Company,
roused by the imposing numbers of his army, had
sent him six hundred European soldiers under command
of Stringer Lawrence in person. At the end of March
the hostile armies stood within striking distance of each
other midway between Pondicherry and Arcot, near
the fortress of Gingee; but no blow was struck. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
mutiny of the French troops practically broke up
Murzapha Jung's army; Murzapha himself surrendered
to Nasir Jung; and the whole of Dupleix's grand
combinations seemed to be shattered beyond repair.
With inexhaustible energy, however, the French
Governor set himself to restore the discipline of the
troops, and meanwhile opened negotiations with Nasir
Jung. Finding his overtures rejected he boldly surprised
his camp by night with a handful of men, and
with such effect that Nasir Jung retreated hurriedly to
Arcot. The British, thus abandoned, retired likewise
to Fort St. David, and the field was left open once
more to the ambition of Dupleix.</p>

<p>Thoroughly understanding the Oriental character,
he hastened to follow up this first blow with another.
First he turned upon Mohammed Ali, who had been
left in isolation near Pondicherry, dispersed his army,
though vastly superior to his own, almost without loss
of a man, and sent him flying northward. He then
detached one of his best officers, M. de Bussy, with a
handful of troops against the fugitives of Mohammed
Ali's force which had rallied under the walls of Gingee;
and Bussy not only routed them in the field but actually
carried the fort of Gingee itself, for generations deemed
an impregnable stronghold, by escalade. This feat, one
of the most brilliant and marvellous ever achieved by
Europeans in India, provoked Nasir Jung anew to try
his fortune in the field and lured him on to his destruction.
Notwithstanding the lateness of the season he
collected a vast unwieldy host of a hundred thousand
men and moved down to Gingee, only to find military
operations absolutely impossible owing to the breaking
of the monsoon. For three months he remained perforce
inactive, while Dupleix sedulously fostered sedition
and conspiracy in his camp. At last, in December, the
French attacked and utterly defeated his army, while
the conspirators made an end of Nasir Jung himself.
Murzapha Jung was at once saluted as Viceroy of the
Deccan, and a few days later was solemnly installed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
such at Pondicherry; Dupleix, in all the splendour of
Oriental robes, sitting by his side as one of equal rank,
to receive with him the homage of the subordinate
princes. The French Governor was declared Nabob of
the whole of the country south of the Kistnah to Cape
Comorin, and Chunda Sahib was appointed Nabob of
Arcot and of its dependencies under him; his former
rival, Mohammed Ali, being only too glad to gain
Dupleix's favour by renouncing all pretensions of his
own. Finally, new privileges and concessions were
showered on the French East India Company. To
such a height indeed had French ascendency risen that
Dupleix gave orders for the erection of a city with
the pompous title of the Place of the Victory of
Dupleix.</p>

</span>.</div>

<p>Nothing now remained but to escort the new Viceroy
of the Deccan to his capital at Aurungabad, a duty which
was entrusted to Bussy. At one point in the march some
opposition was encountered, which, though easily swept
aside by the French artillery, proved fatal to Murzapha
Jung. His vindictive temper led him forward to a personal
contest of man to man, and while actually within
reach of the goal of his ambition he was struck dead.
The incident, untoward though it might appear at such
a time, proved to be of little moment. One puppet
would serve as well as another for Viceroy of the Deccan,
so the actual sovereignty rested with Dupleix. Salabat
Jung, a younger brother of Nasir Jung, was accordingly
released by Bussy from the prison in which he was confined,
and was elevated with general approval to the place
of the potentate whose career had been so unfortunately
cut short. Needless to say, he at once confirmed all former
privileges to the French and added yet others to them.
Finally, in June, the poor creature entered Aurungabad
in state, attended by Bussy and his troops, who did not
omit to take up their quarters permanently in the capital.
Thus from the Vindhya mountains to the Kistnah the
country was practically under the control of Bussy,
while from the Kistnah to Cape Comorin Dupleix ruled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
as actual vicegerent of the Mohammedan sovereign of
the Deccan. The moment marks the zenith of French
power in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March.<br />May.</div>

<p>Throughout these transactions the British had remained
open-mouthed and inactive, so inactive that in
October 1750 they had permitted their ablest soldier,
Stringer Lawrence, to return to England. Thoroughly
alarmed at the rapid progress of Dupleix's influence,
and irritated by the ostentatious display of his sovereignty
on its boundaries, the Company at last resolved
to initiate a steady policy of opposition to the French
in all quarters. There was but one pretext for intervention.
Mohammed Ali, the son of the late Nabob
Anwarudeen, while negotiating with Dupleix for the
surrender of Trichinopoly, had never ceased to make
piteous appeals for British assistance. Rather, therefore,
than allow this last excuse for interference to be taken
from them, the British authorities consented to give
him help, and as a first instalment despatched three
hundred British and as many Sepoys to Trichinopoly
in February 1751. The main issue now turned on the
possession of Trichinopoly, and Dupleix was not slow
to recognise the fact. Chunda Sahib was already preparing
to march upon the city with a native army of
about eight thousand men, and to these Dupleix added
four hundred French under an able officer. The British
replied by equipping a further force of five hundred
Europeans, one hundred Africans, and a thousand
Sepoys, under the command of Captain Gingen, with
Lieutenant Robert Clive for his commissariat-officer.
Not daring to act as principal, for French and English
were still nominally at peace, Gingen waited at Fort St.
David until the middle of May, when he was joined by
sixteen hundred of Mohammed Ali's troops. Vested
by the advent of this rabble with the character of a
legitimate auxiliary, he then marched southward to seize
the pagoda of Verdachelum, which commanded the
communications between Fort St. David and Trichinopoly.
This was successfully accomplished; and having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
received further reinforcements he moved south-westward
to Volconda, on the road between Arcot and
Trichinopoly, to intercept the advancing army of
Chunda Sahib.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
July <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">17</span>
  <span class="blka over">28</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>The result was disastrous for Gingen. After the
exchange of a few cannon-shots the British troops were
seized with panic, flung down their arms, and could not
be rallied even by Clive himself. Gingen, finding them
much shaken, thereupon fell back upon Trichinopoly.
Chunda Sahib immediately followed them; and after
three days of skirmishing the British crossed the river
Coleroon and finally took refuge under the walls of the
city. The enemy lost no time in closing in around
them, and now the French could look upon their success
as well-nigh assured. Almost the whole of the British
force in India was cooped up in the city before them;
there seemed to be no prospect of relief for them from
any other quarter, and it was therefore necessary only
to keep them strictly blockaded to make them prisoners
in a body.</p>

<p>The British authorities in Fort St. David saw the
danger, but could not divine how to avert it. A small
force of Europeans had lately arrived from England,
but every military officer was shut up in Trichinopoly,
and there was not one at hand to take charge of a
relieving force. None the less a convoy was equipped
at the end of July and sent off with an escort of eighty
Europeans and three hundred Sepoys under command
of a civilian, Mr. Pigot, with Robert Clive, who had
returned from the army after the retreat from Volconda,
as second in command. Pigot conducted his convoy
safely as far as Verdachelum and passed his reinforcement
successfully into Trichinopoly, but both he and
Clive were cut off while returning to Fort St. David,
and only with the greatest difficulty evaded capture.
Clive, now raised to the rank of captain, was presently
sent into Tanjore with a second reinforcement, which,
like its predecessor, contrived to make its way into
Trichinopoly, and raised the strength of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
battalion therein to six hundred men. But the French
on their side could bring nine hundred Europeans to
meet them; and the salvation of Trichinopoly, and of
British power in India which lay bound up in it, seemed
to be hopeless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
August.<br />
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">Aug. 26</span>
  <span class="blka over">Sept. 6.</span>
</span></div>

<p>Clive grasped at once the significance of the situation,
and without wasting further time over the blockaded
city returned with all haste to Madras. The only
hope for Trichinopoly, as he pointed out, lay in a
vigorous diversion which should carry the war into the
enemy's country. Though the bulk of the British
forces might be shut up in Trichinopoly, the bulk of
Chunda Sahib's army was equally tied down before it,
and therefore the capital of the Carnatic must be left
unguarded. Let a bold stroke be aimed at Arcot, and
Chunda Sahib must either raise the siege of Trichinopoly
to save it, or suffer a loss for which the gain of Trichinopoly
would be poor compensation. The plan was
audacious beyond measure, but the Governor, Mr.
Saunders, a resolute and far-seeing man, perceived its
merit; so reducing the garrisons of Madras and Fort
St. David to the lowest point he equipped a force of two
hundred Europeans and three hundred Sepoys, together
with three field-guns, and placed Clive in command
with unlimited powers. With this handful of men and
eight officers, of whom four had like himself been taken
from desk and ledger, Clive marched on the 6th of
September from Madras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">Aug. 31</span>
  <span class="blka over">Sept. 11.</span>
</span></div>

<p>Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, and then the seat
of Chunda Sahib's government, lies sixty-four miles to
south and west of Madras. It was then an open town
of about one hundred thousand inhabitants, with no
defences but a ruined fort, which was held by a garrison
of a thousand natives. Five days, including a halt of
one day at Conjeveram, sufficed to bring Clive within
ten miles of the city. At this point he again made a
short halt, but resuming his march through a terrific
thunderstorm pushed forward to the gates on the same
evening. Rumour of his approach had gone before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
him. Spies had reported that the British were striding
on unconcerned through lightning, rain, and tempest;
and the garrison, afraid to oppose a man who set the
very elements at defiance, evacuated the fort without
firing a shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">

<p>Clive at once occupied the deserted fort, repaired
the defences, mounted the guns that he found there, and
made every preparation to resist a siege. The native
garrison having encamped about six miles from the city,
Clive made two successful sorties against them, in order
to keep them in a becoming state of alarm; and hearing
a week later that they had been reinforced to a
strength of three thousand men, he burst suddenly upon
their camp by night, killed several, sent the rest flying
away in panic terror, and returned to the fort without
the loss of a man. But by this time Chunda Sahib had
heard of the misfortune to his capital, and had detached
four thousand men from before Trichinopoly to recapture
the fort. Dupleix, though greatly averse to
any diminution of the blockading army, added one
hundred French soldiers to this detachment, while other
levies raised it to a total of ten thousand men. With
this force Raju Sahib, Chunda Sahib's son, entered
Arcot on the 4th of October and began the investment
of the fort.</p>

<p>On the very next day Clive made a bold sally with the
object of driving the enemy from the town, but was
driven back with the loss, very serious in view of his
numbers, of two officers and thirty-one European soldiers
killed and wounded. On the morrow the besiegers
received further reinforcement, which raised their numbers
to eleven thousand natives and one hundred and
fifty Europeans; whereas Clive's garrison was by this
time reduced to six score Europeans and two hundred
Sepoys only. A fortnight later the enemy's battering
train arrived, and on the 10th of November, a practicable
breach having been made in the walls, Raju Sahib
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'summond Clive'">summoned Clive</ins> to surrender. He was answered by a
message of contemptuous defiance; but knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the supplies of the fort were running low, he hesitated
to storm, in the hope of reducing the garrison by
starvation. Meanwhile, however, Governor Saunders
was pushing forward reinforcements, and had induced
the Mahrattas, under the redoubtable Morari Rao, to
throw in their lot with the British. Intelligence of this
last put an end to Raju Sahib's inaction, and on the
24th of November he laid his plans for an assault. The
day chosen was the festival of the brothers Hassan and
Hussein, an anniversary on which Mohammedan fanaticism
is inflamed always to its fiercest heat. Fortunately
Clive had been warned by a spy of the intended attack,
and had made such preparations as he could by training
cannon on to the breach, and keeping relays of muskets
loaded for the maintenance of a continuous fire. At
dawn the enemy's troops swarmed up to the breach,
while elephants, with their heads armoured by plates
of iron, were brought forward to batter down the
gates. But the fire of the British was too hot and deadly
to be endured, and the elephants, galled by wounds,
swerved back and trampled all around them under foot.
Once only the storming-party seemed likely to gain
ground, and then Clive, taking personal charge of one
of the field-guns, dispersed them effectively with three
or four rounds. After maintaining the attack for an
hour the enemy fell back defeated. The French for
some reason held aloof, and the bravest of the native
leaders were killed. How hot the affair was while it
lasted may be judged from the fact that Clive's garrison,
though reduced to eighty Europeans and one hundred
and twenty Sepoys, expended twelve thousand cartridges
during the assault. The loss of the defenders was
but six killed and wounded; that of the enemy was
reckoned at not less than four hundred. On the following
day Raju Sahib raised the siege and marched away,
abandoning several guns and a great quantity of ammunition;
and Clive was left in Arcot triumphant. The
siege had lasted fifty days and had cost the little garrison
one-fourth of its number in killed alone, besides a still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
greater number wounded; but this was no heavy price
to pay for the re-establishment of British prestige. The
feast of Hassan and Hussein may justly be accounted the
birthday of our empire in India.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day of the assault Clive was
joined by a reinforcement of men and of four guns,
which enabled him, after leaving a garrison in the fort,
to take the field with two hundred Europeans and seven
hundred Sepoys. Raju Sahib's army had in great measure
disbanded itself during his retreat, none remaining with
him except his small party of French and the men which
he had brought with him from Trichinopoly. With
these he retired <ins class="corr" title="Errata&mdash;Original text: 'southward'">westward</ins> to Vellore. There a reinforcement
from Pondicherry increased the number of
his French to three hundred, while the successful repulse
of a rash attack of Mahrattas had served to raise the
spirits of his troops. But Clive, though inferior in
numbers, was not the man to let them escape scot free.
Picking up six hundred Mahratta horsemen he made a
forced march in pursuit of them and caught them as they
were about to cross the river Arnee. The enemy could
show three hundred Europeans against two hundred,
fifteen hundred Sepoys against seven hundred, and three
thousand native levies against the Mahratta horse; but
they were out-manœuvred and defeated, with the loss of
fifty Europeans, thrice as many natives, and the whole
of their artillery, while Clive's loss did not exceed eight
Sepoys and fifty Mahrattas. After this action Clive
marched on Conjeveram, captured it after a siege of
three days and dismantled the fort. Then, having
thrown a strong garrison into Arcot, he returned at the
end of December to Fort St. David to concert measures
for the relief of Trichinopoly.</p>

<p>No sooner was his back turned than the scattered
levies of Raju Sahib reassembled; and having first
restored the defences of Conjeveram and thrown a
garrison into it to cut off communication between
Madras and Arcot, ravaged the country to within a
few miles of Madras itself. This diversion, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
brought about at the instigation of Dupleix, had the
effect which he desired. The preparations for the
relief of Trichinopoly were suspended, and on the 13th
of February Clive marched from Madras with three
hundred and eighty Europeans and thirteen hundred
Sepoys, together with six guns; the troops being drawn
in great part from the garrison at Arcot. The enemy,
though superior in strength of Europeans and very far
superior in native troops and artillery, would not await
his coming, but retired to an entrenched camp at
Vendalore, about five-and-twenty miles south-westward
of Madras. Clive hurried after them, but arriving at
Vendalore at three o'clock in the afternoon found that
they had disappeared, no one knew whither. A few
hours later he received certain information that they
were gone to Conjeveram. It was now nine o'clock
in the evening, and the men had already marched
twenty-five miles on that day, but Clive without a
moment's hesitation called them out for another forced
march, and by four o'clock next morning had reached
Conjeveram. The garrison of the fort surrendered at
the first summons, but gave the bad news that the
enemy had marched on Arcot. Clive's troops were
too much exhausted to follow them at once, but at
noon the march was resumed. At sunset Clive
had reached Covrepauk, sixteen miles on his road,
when his advanced guard was surprised by a sudden
fire of nine field-guns upon its right flank. The
enemy, failing in their design against the fort of Arcot,
had retraced their steps by a forced march and laid an
ambush for Clive; and Clive, quite unsuspectingly,
had marched straight into it.</p>

<p>The position taken up by the enemy was well fitted
for their purpose. About a furlong to the north of
the road, or on the right of Clive as he advanced, was
a dense grove of mango-trees covered in front by a
ditch and a bank; and here were stationed the nine
field-guns of the French with a body of infantry in
support. On Clive's left, or to the south of the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and about one hundred and fifty yards from it ran a
dry water-course, in the bed of which troops were well
sheltered from fire; and here was massed the remainder
of the enemy's infantry. Between the road and the
water-course and beyond the water-course to the southward
was drawn up the enemy's cavalry, some two
thousand in all, ready to bar the British advance to
the front or to sweep round upon their rear. The
peril of Clive's position, already formidable enough,
was enhanced by his inferiority in numbers, for the
French could match four hundred Europeans against
his three hundred and eighty, and two thousand Sepoys
against his eighteen hundred; while against their two
thousand horsemen Clive could not produce a man.
Without losing his presence of mind for an instant
Clive at once brought up three of his field-guns to
reply to the French artillery, ordered the main body
of his infantry to take shelter in the water-course,
directed the baggage to be drawn back for half a mile
with one gun and a small guard to defend it, and posted
his two remaining guns, with forty Europeans and two
hundred Sepoys, to the south of the water-course to
check the enemy's cavalry. The rapidity with which he
grasped the situation, surprised as he was in the waning
light, and the readiness with which he made his dispositions
to meet the danger, suffice in themselves to
distinguish Clive as a man almost unmatched for steadfastness
and resource.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sun went down, and the moon shone
cold and white to light the combatants to battle. In
the water-course the French infantry, six abreast,
encountered the English, and exchanged a savage fire
at close range; but both sides, worn out with long
marching, recoiled from a fight with the bayonet. On
the other flank the British gunners, though outnumbered
by three to one, stood to their guns and fell
by them under the ceaseless rain of fire from the French
pieces. And all the time the enemy's cavalry careered
restlessly backward and forward, now pressing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
guns to the south of the water-course, now swooping
on the infantry that guarded them, now making a dash
upon the baggage, but never charging home, for they
dared not face the white man. So the combat went
fitfully on for three full hours under the silver moon,
but the red flashes never ceased to leap from the shadow
of the grove, and the British artillerymen were at last
so much thinned that there were scarce enough of them
to work the guns. It was plain that unless the French
battery could be silenced the battle was lost. Clive
bethought him that the mango-grove, though protected
by the ditch in front, might be open in the rear, and
sent a native sergeant round to reconnoitre. The
sergeant returned to report that the rear of the battery
was unguarded; and Clive, withdrawing two hundred
of the British from the water-course, marched off
stealthily at their head, with the sergeant for his guide.
Like Cromwell at Dunbar he wished to direct the
turning movement that was to decide the day; but no
sooner was he gone than the troops in the water-course
began to waver. The whole of them ceased firing and
prepared for flight: some of them, indeed, did actually
make off. Perforce Clive returned to rally them and
appointed Lieutenant Keene to command the turning
movement in his place.</p>

<p>Making a wide circuit to avoid discovery, Keene
stole round to the rear of the mango-grove, halted
within three hundred yards of it and sent Ensign
Symmonds forward to examine the French dispositions.
Symmonds was not gone far when he came upon a
deep trench, in which a detachment of infantry was
taking shelter until its time for action should come. He
was challenged as he drew nearer, and could see muskets
pointed at him, but answering calmly in French he was
allowed to pass and to enter the grove in rear of the
French guns. Behind the battery stood a detachment
of one hundred French soldiers, all gazing eagerly
towards the failing fire of the British cannon in their
front, and without any precaution against attack from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the rear. Symmonds stole back to his men, avoiding
the trench; and the two hundred British advanced
silently and noiselessly, by the track of his return, into
the grove, halted under the deep shadow of the mangos
within thirty yards of the French detachment and fired
a volley. The effect was instantaneous. Many of the
French fell, the rest of them broke, the artillerymen
abandoned their guns, and the whole fled away in
confusion, they knew not whither, through the trees,
with the British in pursuit. A building in the grove
presented a refuge, and there the fugitives crowded in,
not knowing what they did, one on the top of another
until they were packed so tightly that they could not
use their arms. The British presently came up with
them and offered quarter, whereupon the whole of
them surrendered as prisoners of war. Meanwhile the
silence of the French battery told Clive of Keene's
success, and his troops in the water-course regained
their confidence. Presently a few of the fugitive
French who had escaped capture came running up to
their comrades with news of the disaster in the grove,
and therewith the whole of the enemy's infantry in the
water-course incontinently took to flight. The native
cavalry was not slow to follow the example, and very
soon all sign of an enemy had vanished and the victory
was won. Clive gathered his men together, and the
exhausted army lay under arms until the moon paled
and the sun rose up to show what manner of victory it
had won. On the field fifty French soldiers and three
hundred Sepoys lay dead; sixty more French had been
captured in the grove, and the whole of the French
artillery was abandoned to the British. Of Clive's
force forty Europeans and thirty Sepoys were killed
and a still greater number wounded, no extravagant
price to pay for so far-reaching a success.</p>

<p>For by Covrepauk not only was the work begun at
Arcot completed but Trichinopoly was saved; not only
was British military reputation established but supremacy
in the south of India was wrenched from the French.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
It was essentially a general's action, Clive's action; and
when we reflect on the hours that preceded it, hours
of continuous marching, doubtful information, and
incessant anxiety, we can only marvel at the moral and
physical strength which enabled him to present instantly
a bold front, to keep his weary soldiers together during
those four hours of fighting by moonlight, and to devise
and execute the counterstroke which won the day.</p>

<p>From Covrepauk Clive marched on to Arcot, and
was proceeding southward from thence when he was
recalled to Fort St. David, to command an expedition
which was preparing for the relief of Trichinopoly.
On his way he passed the growing city which was to
commemorate the victories of Dupleix and razed it to
the ground;<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> but he met with no trace of an enemy.
Raju Sahib's army had dispersed; the French and their
Sepoys had been recalled to Pondicherry; and Raju
Sahib himself, on returning thither from the scene of
his defeat, was received by Dupleix with a displeasure
and contempt which showed how deeply the dart of
Clive's victory was rankling in the breast of the ambitious
Frenchman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, through all these months the French
had maintained the siege of Trichinopoly, feebly indeed
but persistently. In September 1751 their battering
train had arrived and batteries had been erected before
the town, but, like Boscawen's before Pondicherry, at
too great a distance to do effectual damage. In fact
the French commander, Law, a nephew of the famous
Scottish financier, had proved himself both unenterprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and incompetent. The force under his orders comprised
the unparalleled number of nine hundred French troops
and two thousand Sepoys, over and above the thirty
thousand native levies of Chunda Sahib; yet he had
effected little or nothing. He was now to be put to a
sterner test than the mere blockading of an inferior force
under an inactive leader. The supreme command of
the expedition for the relief of Trichinopoly was indeed
taken from Clive at the last moment, but only to be
transferred to Stringer Lawrence, who had just returned
from England. Moreover Clive was to accompany
Lawrence as a trusted subordinate, so that the change
signified only the presence of two officers of conspicuous
ability instead of one. Dupleix's instructions to Law
were explicit: to leave the least possible number of his
troops to continue the blockade of Trichinopoly, and
to march out with the rest to intercept the relieving
army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
March <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">17</span>
  <span class="blka over">28</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>On the 28th of March Lawrence started from Fort
St. David at the head of four hundred Europeans
and eleven hundred Sepoys, together with eight guns
and a large convoy of stores. The distance to be
traversed was about one hundred and fifty miles, and
the way was barred by several rivers. The most important
of these was the Coleroon, which a few miles
above Trichinopoly parts itself into two branches, the
northern branch retaining the name of Coleroon while
the southern becomes the Cauvery. It is on the south
bank of the Cauvery, and about three miles below the
parting of the streams, that Trichinopoly stands. The
long narrow strip of land between the two branches is
called the island of Seringham, on which, about fifteen
miles below and to eastward of Trichinopoly, stood the
fort of Coilady, barring the advance of any enemy from
that side. About six miles up the river from Coilady
the Cauvery splits again into two branches, and it was
along the narrow delta between these two branches that
the advance of Lawrence must necessarily be made. The
ordinary road passed within range of the guns of Coilady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
across the Cauvery; and Law, assuming that the British
would certainly follow it, threw the whole of his intercepting
army into the fort. Lawrence, on learning of
this disposition, naturally looked for another road, and
although, by an error of his guides, the British did come
under the fire of Coilady and suffer some loss, yet Law
took no advantage of the favourable moment. Lawrence
therefore was able to cross the river and to
advance on the same evening to within ten miles of
Trichinopoly.</p>

<p>On the following day Law took up a position astride
of the direct road to Trichinopoly, extending obliquely
from the village of Chukleypollam on the south bank
of the Cauvery past a rocky eminence known as French
Rock, whereon he had mounted cannon, and thence to
another almost inaccessible rock called Elimiseram.
Lawrence, apprised of these dispositions, made a circuit
to southward which carried him outside Elimiseram,
and a mile beyond it effected a junction with a detachment
of the garrison which had been sent forward to
meet him under Captain Dalton. Law now made a
feeble and half-hearted attempt at an attack; but the
action soon resolved itself into a duel of artillery, from
which the French retired with heavy loss, leaving
Lawrence to enter Trichinopoly unmolested.</p>

<p>A few days later Law, taking fright at a threatening
movement of the British against some of his native
levies, resolved forthwith to withdraw from the south
of the Cauvery to the island of Seringham. In such
haste did he execute this pusillanimous decision that he
abandoned most of his baggage, destroyed vast quantities
of stores, and left a small garrison isolated at Elimiseram,
which was promptly captured by the British.
Clive then proposed to cut matters short by dividing
the British forces into two bodies, one to remain to the
south of the Cauvery, the other to cross without delay
to the north bank of the Coleroon, in order to cut off
the supplies of the French and sever their communications
with Pondicherry. Lawrence assented, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
night of the 17th of April four hundred British, seven
hundred Sepoys and four thousand Mahratta and Tanjorine
horse, together with six field-guns, crossed the
Cauvery and Coleroon under Clive himself, and took
up a position at Samiaveram, about nine miles north of
Seringham, on the road to Pondicherry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dupleix with unconquerable energy had,
on the news of Law's retreat, despatched one hundred
and twenty Europeans and four hundred Sepoys to him
under M. d'Auteuil. Leaving Pondicherry on the 10th
of April, D'Auteuil marched to within fifteen miles of
Clive's position at Samiaveram, and resolved to advance
from thence by a circuitous route to the Coleroon in
order to avoid him. Clive, however, having intercepted
one of the messengers sent by D'Auteuil to apprise Law
of his intentions, moved out to meet him; whereupon
D'Auteuil, learning in turn of Clive's advance, retreated
to Uttatoor, while Clive on his side hastened back to
Samiaveram. Meanwhile Law, hearing of Clive's departure
from Samiaveram but not of his return, sent a
force of eighty Europeans, forty of whom were British
deserters, and seven hundred Sepoys to attack his camp,
as he supposed, during his absence. At midnight of
the 26th of April Law's party approached the English
encampment. Clive, never dreaming of such enterprise
on the part of the French commander, was in bed and
asleep. As the French drew nearer they were challenged
by a sentry of the British Sepoys; but the officer of the
deserters, an Irishman, stepped forward and explained
that he was come with a reinforcement from Major
Lawrence, and the sentry, hearing the deserters speak
English, allowed them, after some hesitation, to pass.
The British troops at Samiaveram occupied two pagodas
a quarter of a mile apart, and the native troops were
encamped around them. The French marched through
the heart of the natives' camp and came to the smaller
of the two pagodas, near which Clive was sleeping under
an open shed in his palanquin. Here they were again
challenged. They answered by firing a volley into both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
pagoda and shed, and then, pressing into the pagoda,
put all within it to the sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
April <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">16</span>
  <span class="blka over">27</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>Clive, startled out of his sleep, and never doubting
but that the fire was the result of a false alarm, ran to
the greater pagoda, turned out two hundred of his
Europeans and hurried back with them to the shed.
Here he found a large body of French Sepoys drawn up
before it and firing incessantly at they knew not what,
but in the direction of Seringham. Confirmed by this
circumstance in the idea that these were his own men,
for the darkness obliterated all distinctions of dress, he
drew up his Europeans in their rear and ran in among
them, rebuking and even striking them for what he
supposed to be their panic. For some minutes this
absurd position remained unchanged, until one of the
Sepoys discovering at last that Clive was a Englishman,
attacked him and wounded him in two places with his
sword. Clive turned upon him instantly, and the Sepoy
finding himself overpowered fled into the pagoda pursued
by Clive, who was now in the highest pitch of
exasperation over what he conceived to be the mutinous
behaviour of one of his own men. To his amazement
Clive was accosted at the gate by six Frenchmen; and
then at last he was undeceived. With astonishing composure
he told them that he was come to offer them
terms, and invited them to see his whole army drawn up
ready to attack them. Completely deceived by his
confidence the French surrendered; and Clive then
prepared to attack the Sepoys, but found that they were
already withdrawn out of reach of his Europeans.
There still remained, however, the larger force of the
enemy's Europeans, including the British deserters, which
had occupied the greater pagoda. These last refused to
surrender, and made so desperate a resistance that at daybreak
Clive approached them to open a parley. Owing
to weakness from loss of blood he was obliged to lean
on the shoulders of two sergeants; but the officer of
the deserters, whether through desperation or sheer
brutality, at once presented a musket at him and fired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
The bullet missed Clive but wounded both of the sergeants
to death; whereupon the French soldiers, fearing
that their apparent connivance with such an act might
debar them from any claim to quarter, immediately laid
down their arms. All the Europeans of the enemy's
force being now secured, the Mahratta horse was
despatched in pursuit of the retreating Sepoys, whom
they overtook before they had reached the Coleroon and
cut down to a man. Thus for the second time did
Clive's marvellous presence of mind not only pluck
himself and his troops out of deadly peril, but turn his
enemies' devices with terrible retribution upon their
own head.</p>

<p>After this repulse the toils closed rapidly round the
French in Seringham. On the 7th of May Lawrence
captured the fort of Coilady together with all the stores
therein and cut off Law from communication with the
east; and after this little remained to be done except to
dispose of D'Auteuil, who still lingered at Uttatoor waiting
for an opportunity to effect a junction with Law.
On the 9th of May Lawrence detached Captain Dalton
with five hundred Europeans and Sepoys and as many
Mahratta horse to oust him; a task which Dalton
accomplished by making such a display of his force that
D'Auteuil, conceiving Clive's whole army to be upon
him, retreated after a faint resistance to Volconda. In
the course of the next few days Clive captured an important
post which severed Law's communications with
the north and commanded the camp of Seringham.
Thereupon the greater part of Chunda Sahib's army
deserted, some of the men even taking service with
Clive. Shortly afterwards the British crossed the Cauvery
and established themselves on the island of Seringham
itself, hemming the French in closer and closer. Then
D'Auteuil, roused by the desperate state of his comrade,
took courage and again moved southward from Volconda.
Clive was at once despatched with a force to
Uttatoor to meet him; but D'Auteuil's heart again
failed him when he arrived within seven miles of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
position, and he retreated hastily towards Volconda.
He was not, however, to escape thus easily. Clive at
once pushed forward the Mahrattas to harass him on the
march; his Sepoys, veterans of Arcot, marched their
swiftest after the Mahrattas and opened the attack by
themselves; and last of all the British, who had been
unable to keep pace with the Sepoys, arrived at the
scene of action, when D'Auteuil, seeing resistance to be
hopeless, surrendered. His force consisted of but one
hundred Europeans and less than eight hundred Sepoys
and natives, of whom the latter were at once disarmed
and released. Thus vanished Law's last hope of relief.
Chunda Sahib in vain urged him to make a sally against
the divided forces of the British, and to cut his way out
to Carical. Law would not move. On the 13th of
June he surrendered; and eight hundred French troops
and two thousand Sepoys became prisoners of war, while
forty-one pieces of artillery passed into the hands of the
victors. A few days later Chunda Sahib, who had made
terms of surrender for himself, was treacherously assassinated
by order of the Tanjorine General, and his head
was sent to his successful rival, Mohammed Ali. Thus
for the present ended the long agony of the contest for
Trichinopoly. To all appearance Dupleix was really
beaten at last; but his resources were not yet exhausted,
and the last battle had not yet been fought before the
city on the Cauvery.</p>

<p class="noindent">No sooner was the victory gained at Trichinopoly than
the Nabob Mohammed Ali and his allies the Mysoreans
and Mahrattas fell at variance over the division
of the spoil. This complication, which was due in
great measure to the intrigues of Dupleix, thoroughly
answered his purpose; for the British, who had marched
northward as far as Uttatoor to prosecute the campaign
in the Carnatic, found themselves obliged to return to
Trichinopoly. Finally two hundred Englishmen and
two thousand Sepoys under Captain Dalton were left in
the city to keep the peace; the Mahrattas and Mysoreans
still keeping their former position to westward of the
city, and occupying, by leave of Mohammed Ali, the
pagoda which formed the strongest post on the island of
Seringham. The remainder of the British army then
resumed its march to northward, but with all hope of
future operations frustrated by this untoward diminution
of its strength. Advancing by Volconda and Verdachelum
Lawrence on the 17th of July took Trivady,
which was held by a small party of French Sepoys, and
there left the army, to return to Fort St. David on
sick-leave. Clive had already proceeded thither for the
same reason, and the British force was left under the
command of Major Gingen, an officer of tried incapacity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dupleix's activity had never ceased.
While the native confederates were quarrelling over the
success at Trichinopoly the annual reinforcement of
troops arrived from France, and these, by dint of taking
sailors from the ships, he increased to a strength of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
hundred European soldiers. This done he waited only
for an opportunity for retrieving the reputation of the
French arms. Such an opportunity soon came. Yielding
to the fanciful representations of Mohammed Ali,
but contrary to the wishes of Lawrence, Governor
Saunders ordered Gingen to detach a portion of his
force against the fortress of Gingee. Gingen accordingly
told off two hundred Europeans, fifteen hundred
Sepoys and six hundred native cavalry for the task,
the command being entrusted to Major Kinnear, an
officer only recently arrived from Europe and wholly
without experience of India. What the object of such
an enterprise can have been it is difficult to divine.
Gingee, it is true, was above all fortresses in India
bound up with the glory of France, and its capture
would therefore have dealt a blow at French military
reputation; but Gingee, held by trained troops under
an European commander, was not to be taken again as
Bussy had taken it, when defended by undisciplined
natives only. Kinnear on approaching the fortress
perceived his task to be hopeless, and while still hesitating
as to his movements found that Dupleix had
moved a French force, under command of his nephew,
M. Kerjean, in his rear, to cut off his communications
with Trivady. Nothing daunted Kinnear faced about
and attacked Kerjean, but was repulsed with heavy
loss; and the native princes, finding their faith in the
invincibility of the British thus disappointed, began
again to veer round to the side of the French. Most
opportunely also for himself Dupleix received at this
time the confirmation from Delhi of his appointment
of Nabob of the country south of the Kistnah. With
his usual cleverness he selected Raju Sahib, the son of
Chunda Sahib, to hold the post subject to himself,
thus reasserting himself as Dupleix the king-maker.
Strengthened by this accession of dignity he renewed
his intrigues with the Mysoreans and Mahrattas, who
engaged themselves to embrace the side of the French
if Dupleix would find means to distract the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
British army from Trichinopoly and leave them free
to do what they would with the city. Dupleix
accordingly as a first step reinforced Kerjean to a
strength of two thousand trained men, one-fourth of
them Europeans, and five hundred native horse, and
sent him to blockade Fort St. David and cut its communications
with Trichinopoly.</p>

<p>Lawrence on learning of this movement at once
embarked from Fort St. David for Madras, and marched
from thence with a force nearly equal to Kerjean's to
attack him. Kerjean, however, fell back, closely
followed by Lawrence, until he was within a league of
Pondicherry and on French soil, where Lawrence's
instructions forbade him to take aggressive action.
Lawrence thereupon, as though in dread of a regular
engagement, retreated with precipitation to Bahoor, two
miles from Fort St. David, in the hope that Kerjean
would pursue him. Kerjean and his master Dupleix
with him both fell into the snare; and the French force
advancing in pursuit of the British encamped within
two miles of Bahoor. At three o'clock on the following
morning the British force marched off to attack him,
the Sepoys seventeen hundred strong in the first line,
the English four hundred strong in the second, while
four hundred native horse advanced parallel to them
on the farther side of a high bank which ran from the
right of Lawrence's position to the French camp. A
little before dawn the British Sepoys struck against the
French outposts and skirmished with them until daylight,
when the battalion of French soldiers, stronger by
fifty men than that of the British, was discovered drawn
up between the bank and a large pond. The British
halted to extend their front to equal that of the French,
a French battery of eight guns playing upon them
vigorously as they executed the movement, and then
advanced firing, platoon after platoon. Closer and
closer they came, still firing; but the French never
shrank for a moment until, rarest of rare incidents, the
bayonets crossed and the two battalions engaged each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
other fiercely hand to hand. At length, however, a
company of British grenadiers, the choicest troops in
India, forced its way though the French centre; upon
which the whole of the French gave way, flung down
their arms and fled. Had the native cavalry then
charged as they were bidden they would utterly have
annihilated Kerjean's troops, but according to their
custom they preferred to plunder the French camp.
The loss of the French in killed and wounded is unknown,
but Kerjean himself with fifteen other officers
and one hundred men were taken prisoners. The
British battalion lost four officers and seventy-eight
men killed and wounded, a sufficient proof of the stubbornness
of the fight.</p>

<p>Signal though this victory might be, Lawrence did
not think it prudent to venture on further operations
until he could ascertain whether the Mahrattas, always
wavering since the dispute after the expulsion of the
French from Trichinopoly, would finally attach themselves
to the British or to their enemies. He therefore
moved to Trivady, designing to reduce the country
northward between Pondicherry and the river Paliar.
Meanwhile the Nabob Mohammed Ali requested that
the forts of Chinglapet and Covelong, which commanded
a considerable tract of country north of the Paliar,
might be captured. The only troops that could be
furnished from Madras for the purpose were two
hundred English recruits, the sweepings of the streets
of London, and five hundred newly raised Sepoys as
untrained as the English. It was unpromising material,
but Clive volunteered to take the command, and to
Clive the task was entrusted. The force accordingly
marched, taking four siege-guns with it, from Madras
on the 10th of September; its first destination being
Covelong, a walled fort on the coast, which was held
by fifty Europeans and three hundred Sepoys. On
arriving before it Clive sent forward a detachment to a
garden within a short distance of the fort, where it was
attacked by the French. Unfortunately the officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
commanding the British was killed, whereupon the men
at once took to their heels. By good luck they ran
against Clive and the main body in their flight, and by
dint of blows and curses they were with some difficulty
rallied and brought back to the garden, which was
evacuated by the French on their approach. On the
following day Clive began the erection of a battery, but
it was only with the greatest trouble and by constant
exposure of himself to the enemy's fire that he could
induce his men to stand. On the third day of the
siege intelligence reached Clive that a French force,
little inferior in numbers to his own, was advancing
from Chinglapet to the relief of Covelong. With his
usual audacity he at once led half of his miserable troops
forth to meet it; but the terror of his name sufficed to
awe the French commander into a precipitate retreat.
Thereupon the garrison of Covelong surrendered, and
Clive on taking possession of the fort found therein
fifty guns which had been taken from Madras by La
Bourdonnais.</p>

  <span class="blka over">Nov. 11.</span>
</span></div>

<p>At daybreak of the following morning Ensign Joseph
Smith discovered a considerable force moving forward
upon Covelong, and concluding that it must be the
French again advancing from Chinglapet, posted such
troops as were with him in ambuscade and hastened to
inform Clive. The conjecture proved to be correct.
The French marched straight into the ambuscade, where
the troops, which Clive had taken over less than a week
before as a spiritless, undisciplined rabble, poured in so
deadly a fire that within a few minutes they struck
down a hundred men. The attack was so unexpected
that half of the French force stood rooted to the ground
with fear. The commanding officer, with a score more
of Europeans, two hundred and fifty Sepoys and two
guns were captured, and the remainder, throwing down
their arms, rushed away in terror to Chinglapet. Clive
resolved to follow them while the panic was still alive.
The fort of Chinglapet, though of native construction,
was designed with more than ordinary native skill; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
mounted fifteen guns and was held by forty Europeans
and five hundred Sepoys. Clive hastened to traverse
the thirty miles that separated it from Covelong, and
after four days' cannonade succeeded in making indeed
a breach, though not such a breach as in the least to
endanger the safety of the fort. But the terror of his
name was again potent, and the garrison surrendered
the place on condition that it should march out with the
honours of war, terms which Clive was very well content
to grant. Thus the country to the north of the Paliar,
from the mouth of the river to Arcot, was subjected to
the allies of the British, all by a handful of men who,
starting as raw and villainous recruits, returned, under
the magic of Clive's leadership, as heroes. This
instance of his power is the more remarkable inasmuch
as throughout the expedition he was in bad health,
which indeed forced him to sail for England as soon as
he had completed the work. His departure from India
was more valuable than a victory to Dupleix.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1753.<br />Jan. 3.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, despite these successes and Lawrence's
brilliant action at Bahoor French influence was, on the
whole, decidedly on the gaining hand. Within six
weeks of Bahoor, thanks to the indefatigable intrigues
of Dupleix, both Mysoreans and Mahrattas had alienated
themselves from the English and openly attached themselves
to the French cause. Dalton had from the first
been troubled by conspiracies and other mischievous
designs of the Mysoreans in Seringham, which compelled
him to take precautions in Trichinopoly as elaborate as
though he were in presence of an enemy. Dupleix,
seeing that affairs were going as he wished, promised to
send some Europeans to help the Mysoreans in Seringham;
and the Mysoreans, thus encouraged, moved a
step further forward and suborned the Mahrattas to cut
off supplies from the city. It was now useless for the
authorities at Madras longer to pretend to treat the
Mysoreans otherwise than as enemies. Accordingly,
early in January 1753 Dalton attempted a surprise of
their camp in Seringham, which though at first successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
was eventually repulsed with the serious loss of seventy
Europeans and three hundred of the best Sepoys.
Thus the struggle for Trichinopoly, the darling object
of Dupleix's ambition, was reopened, and reopened by a
reverse to the British. Dalton, undismayed though
fully alive to the significance of his failure, now turned
all his attention to the defence of the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March.</div>

<p>His situation indeed was most critical. Even before
his sortie he had discovered that but three weeks' supplies
were left to him, and had urged Lawrence to march
to his relief; and now not only were his communications
with the north severed by the hostile occupation of
Seringham, but a force of eight thousand men had
entrenched itself at a place called Fakir's Tope, four
miles to south-west of the city, to intercept all supplies
from the south. Meanwhile, to divert the British from
Trichinopoly, Dupleix had skilfully engaged Lawrence
in a campaign of petty, harassing operations on the river
Pennar; while the Mahrattas scoured every part of the
Carnatic from the Paliar to the Coleroon, insulting even
the fortifications of Fort St. David. Lawrence in vain
strove to bring the French to action. They were
following the tactics of Saxe in the Low Countries,
always present and therefore always a danger, but always
entrenched to the teeth against attack. Finally, after
an unsuccessful attempt to storm their entrenchments,
Lawrence resolved to adopt the course so often urged
by Ligonier in Flanders, to carry the war into some
other quarter. So far his operations had proved a
failure, and the reputation of the British had accordingly
waned paler than ever in the eyes of the native princes.
He was still hesitating as to the choice of a new theatre
of operations when his mind was made up for him by
the receipt of Dalton's letters from Trichinopoly.</p>

  <span class="blka over">17</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>Throwing a garrison of one hundred and fifty British
and five hundred Sepoys as a garrison into Trivady, he
marched with the remainder by Chillumbrum, Condoor,
and Tanjore for Trichinopoly, and entered the city
unmolested on the 17th of May. Dalton had not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
inactive during the interval, and had done his best to
clear the way for his coming by scaring the enemy from
their position at Fakir's Tope. Nevertheless Lawrence's
men had suffered greatly on the march. Several died
from the effects of the heat, others were sent back to
Fort St. David, and no less than a hundred were carried
straight into hospital at Trichinopoly. Finally, there
was much desertion, in particular from a company of
Swiss which had been sent down from Bengal. Thus,
even including such men of the garrison as could be
spared from duty in the city, he could muster no more
than five hundred Europeans, two thousand Sepoys, and
three thousand native horse for service in the field. To
add to his difficulties Dupleix, on hearing of his march,
had with his usual promptitude despatched M. Astruc
with two hundred Europeans, five hundred Sepoys and
four guns to join the Mahrattas and Mysoreans at
Seringham, which force arrived at its destination only
one day later than Lawrence himself. None the less,
after granting his troops three days' rest Lawrence took
the initiative with his wonted energy, crossed the river
to Seringham with his infantry only, and made a daring
attempt to drive the enemy from the island. Success
was almost within his grasp, and the French were actually
about to retreat when, by an unfortunate misadventure,
the British troops were recalled just at the critical
moment, and the enemy recovering themselves forced
him to fall back. His loss was but slight, but he had
seen sufficient to convince him that for the present he
must confine himself to the defensive.</p>

<p>Meanwhile matters went ill with the British farther
north. The French attacked Trivady and though twice
repulsed succeeded, thanks to a mutiny among the
garrison, in capturing it. A British detachment was
also obliged to evacuate Chillumbrum through the
treachery of the native governor. Thus the control of
these districts was lost, and communication between
Trichinopoly and Fort St. David was hampered, while
swarms of banditti, pretending commissions from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Dupleix, levied contributions and spread lawlessness
through the country. Finally Mortiz Ali, called from
obscurity by Dupleix to replace Raju Sahib as Nabob
of the Carnatic, commenced hostilities in the neighbourhood
of Arcot and even destroyed a small British force.
He was only restrained from further operations in that
quarter by Dupleix who, always with his eye on Trichinopoly,
persuaded him to detach three thousand of his
Mahrattas to Seringham and added to them three
hundred Europeans and a thousand Sepoys. The total
force on the island after the arrival of this reinforcement
amounted to four hundred and fifty Europeans, fifteen
hundred well-trained and over a thousand imperfectly
trained Sepoys, eight thousand Mysorean and over three
thousand Mahratta horse, and a rabble of fifteen thousand
native infantry. After many failures it seemed that
Dupleix at last held the coveted Trichinopoly within
his grasp.</p>

<p>As soon as these troops had joined them the French
quitted Seringham, and crossing to the south side of the
Cauvery encamped in the plain three miles to the north
of Fakir's Tope. A mile to the south of Lawrence's
position some mountains known as the Five Rocks rise
out of the plain, on which he had always maintained a
guard to secure the passage of his supplies from the
south. Unfortunately Lawrence was obliged by sickness
to withdraw from the camp to the city, and during
his absence this guard was withdrawn. The French
thereupon at once seized the Five Rocks and encamped
there with their entire force, thus cutting Lawrence off not
only from his supplies but from seven hundred of his
Sepoys, who were on their way to him from the south
with a convoy. The British commander's position was
now almost desperate. His troops lost heart in the
presence of overwhelming numbers, and desertion became
frequent; Dupleix seemed to be nearer than ever to the
capture of Trichinopoly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">June 26</span>
  <span class="blka over">July 7.</span>
</span></div>

<p>Lawrence had now but one post by which to communicate
with the south, a rocky eminence known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the Golden Rock, about half a mile to south-west of his
camp, which he had occupied with two hundred Sepoys.
On the 7th of July Astruc sallied forth from the French
camp with his grenadiers and a large force of Sepoys to
attack it, knowing that, if he could capture it, his artillery
would force Lawrence to take refuge under the walls of
Trichinopoly, where his surrender or retreat would be
only a question of days. The Sepoys on the Golden
Rock made a stout resistance, and Astruc presently
ordered out the whole of his army to support the attack.
Lawrence observing this detached a hundred Europeans
to guard the camp, and marched with the rest of his
force, a bare three hundred European infantry, eighty
British artillerymen and five hundred Sepoys, to gain
the position before the French army; but ere he could
reach it Astruc by a desperate effort carried the Golden
Rock and killed or captured every Sepoy of the guard.
Lawrence saw the white flag of France flutter from the
summit, and halted. Before the rock itself stood the
French Sepoys with the grenadiers in support; on either
flank of them the French artillery was playing on his
own troops, in rear of the rock was the battalion of
French, with the entire Mysorean army drawn up a
cannon-shot behind him, while the Mahratta horse
scoured the plain in small parties, continually menacing
Lawrence's flanks and rear. The courage of the British
rose to the occasion. After the tedious disappointing
work with the French entrenchments on the Pennar they
asked for nothing better than a brush with their old
enemy in the open field. Lawrence saw with joy the
spirit that was in them. A few words from him served
to heighten it; and then he gave the order to his grenadiers
to fix bayonets and storm the Golden Rock, while
he himself with the rest of the troops should engage the
entire army of the enemy. The men replied with three
cheers: the bayonets sprang flashing from their scabbards,
and the word was given to advance.</p>

<p>Forward strode the grenadiers, at great speed but in
perfect order, with the best of the Sepoys after them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
forward to the base of the Rock, heedless of the spattering
fire from above them, forward to the ascent of it,
forward without dwelling or firing a shot to the summit;
while the enemy, not daring to await the shock of their
onset, scrambled headlong down in terror to the plain.
Meanwhile Lawrence, with his men in beautiful order,
was moving in column round the western side of the
Rock, with the design of falling on the left flank of the
French battalion. Astruc thereupon changed front to
the left to meet him, resting his right flank upon the
Rock; but the movement was hardly completed when
the British column with admirable precision wheeled
into line to its left and halted squarely before him, not
more than twenty yards away. Astruc called to his men
to reserve their fire till the rest of his troops should
deploy and encompass Lawrence's handful of infantry;
when to his amazement, for he had not seen the advance
of the British grenadiers, a heavy fire from the Rock
struck full and true against his right flank and flung it
staggering back. The French line wavered. Lawrence's
men poured in one crushing volley, and before the
French ranks could be closed the British bayonets came
gleaming through the smoke, and Astruc's battalion was
broken up in hopeless confusion. A few rounds of
grape from a British field-gun completed the disorder, and
the whole of the French infantry fled for refuge to the
rear of the Mysoreans, leaving their guns in the hands
of their victors. The Mahratta cavalry dashed forward
to cover their retreat, and cut down a few of the British
grenadiers who had run forward to secure the captured
guns; but they strove in vain to pierce the phalanx of
bayonets about the main body and were repulsed with
heavy loss. Lawrence halted at the foot of the Rock
for three hours, anxious only to renew the fight, and
then prepared to retire to his camp, leaving the French
to occupy the Golden Rock again if they dared.</p>

<p>Then came the critical operation of a retreat across
the plain among the swarms of the enemy's horse.
The three captured guns were placed in the centre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the infantry was formed in platoons on each flank, the
British field-guns distributed in the front, rear and
intervals of the column. Against these two parallel
lines of eight hundred resolute men not even the rush
of ten thousand cavalry could prevail. The infantry
halted at the word with ordered arms as coolly as on
parade, and the gunners waited calmly, linstock in
hand, while the wild horsemen whirled up to them, till
the signal was given and a shower of grape laid men
and horses in scores upon the plain. The havoc
wrought by the British artillery and the sight of the
infantry steady and immovable, reserving their fire, was
too much for the native cavalry. They broke and fled
in all directions, and Lawrence marched proudly back
to his camp, having fought an action as skilful, as
gallant, and as daring as ever was won by British officer
on the blood-stained plains of India.</p>

<p>The victory not only ensured the safe arrival of
Lawrence's convoy from the south, but set the French
and their allies at variance, Mysoreans and French
mutually reproaching each other, and the Mahrattas
impartially blaming both. Astruc resigned his command
and was succeeded by M. Brennier, who continued
the blockade of Trichinopoly. Lawrence being weak in
numbers resolved not to hazard another general action,
but marched with his army into Tanjore, with the double
object of meeting a reinforcement that was on its way
from Madras, and of persuading the wavering king to
take his side and to furnish him with some native horse.
He was successful in both matters, and after a month's
absence turned back towards Trichinopoly, having
obtained three thousand horse and two thousand foot
from Tanjore, and one hundred and seventy Europeans
and three hundred Sepoys from Fort St. David.</p>

<div class="sidenote"
>August <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">9</span>
  <span class="blka over">20</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>On entering the plain with a large convoy Lawrence
was warned by signals from Trichinopoly that the
French were awaiting him. Their cavalry was drawn
up between the Golden Rock and another eminence,
called the Sugar-loaf Rock, about a mile to the east of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
it. The Golden Rock itself was occupied by a detachment,
but the main body of the enemy's infantry and
the whole of their artillery was formed up by the Sugar-loaf
Rock, that being the point where Lawrence, whose
advance was from the south-east, would first come
within their reach. Lawrence on perceiving their dispositions
resolved to hold on his course straight westward,
keeping his convoy wide on his left or unexposed
flank, and so to move round the Golden Rock and wheel
northward upon the city. It was, however, imperative
that he should capture the Golden Rock at whatever
cost, since that position commanded the entire space
between it and Trichinopoly. To conceal his intention
he halted the army a mile to south-east of the Sugar-loaf
and bade the convoy march on alone, at the same
time detaching his grenadiers and eight hundred
Sepoys with orders to defile westward under cover of
the convoy, and at the right moment to move as swiftly
as possible to the attack of the Golden Rock.</p>

<p>Brennier, with no eyes for anything but Lawrence's
menacing attitude before the Sugar-loaf Rock, hastily
recalled most of the detachment from the Golden Rock
to his main position. Then, perceiving too late the
advance of the British grenadiers, he despatched a
thousand native horse at full gallop to check them, and
sent three hundred infantry to reinforce the party on
the Rock. But the cavalry dared not charge home
upon the grenadiers, who without slackening their pace
for an instant swarmed up the Rock, drove out the
enemy, and planted their flag on the summit. The
French reinforcement lost heart at the sight and halted,
and Brennier, who was advancing with the main army,
halted likewise, giving time to Lawrence to bring the
whole of his force up to the Golden Rock. Brennier
then opened a destructive fire of artillery upon the
British, but for some reason left the reinforcement,
which had failed to reach the Golden Rock, still standing
alone and unsupported. Lawrence therefore
detached the grenadiers and five hundred more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Europeans and Sepoys to cut off this isolated party
before Brennier's main body could reach it, giving
orders that it should be broken up with the bayonet.
These troops suffered much from the fire of the
French cannon during their advance, and the officer
in command hesitated to attack; whereupon Lawrence
himself galloped to their head, and the French not
caring to await the shock turned and fled. Dalton, who
had been watching the fight from Trichinopoly, now
came up in their rear with a couple of field-guns and
completed their discomfiture. Then too late Brennier
set the main body in motion; but these seeing the
defeat of their comrades ran off in confusion to the
Five Rocks, with the British guns from the Golden
Rock playing on them all the way. This little combat
cost the French about one hundred and the British
about forty killed and wounded; but its moral effect
was great, since it showed Brennier to be as helpless as
a child in presence of such a commander as Lawrence.</p>

<p>After the action the French retreated to Weycondah,
a strongly fortified post some two miles west of the
city, where they entrenched themselves; but quitted
this stronghold in confusion at the mere menace of an
attack by Lawrence, and retired to the south bank of
the Cauvery. A few weeks more under Brennier would
probably have brought the French to a pitch of demoralisation
which would have simplified Lawrence's
task not a little; but just at this moment the energy of
Dupleix again turned the tables against the British.
Four hundred Europeans, two thousand Sepoys, and
several thousand native troops arrived to reinforce the
French, and, more important still, Astruc arrived with
them to take the command out of Brennier's hands.
Once more, therefore, Lawrence was thrown on the
defensive, and forced back to his old position at Fakir's
Tope. The French likewise moved round to southward
of him, resuming their old position between the Golden
and Sugar-loaf Rocks; and in this posture the two
armies remained, looking at each other across two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
miles of open plain without firing a shot. At last
on the 30th of September Lawrence moved round
to the French Rock, off the south-east side of the
town, to meet a reinforcement which was on its way
to him from the eastward, and brought it in successfully
on the same evening. The reinforcement consisted
of three hundred Sepoys and of two hundred and
thirty-seven Europeans, which latter had just arrived
from England, together with an officer who was soon
to become famous, Captain Caillaud. Small though it
was, and very far from sufficient to equalise the disparity
of numbers between the British and the enemy, its
arrival raised the army's spirits not a little; and
Lawrence, straitened for supplies and fuel, resolved to
bring the enemy to a general action and, if necessary,
to attack them in their camp.</p>

<p>Sending his baggage under cover of night to
Trichinopoly, he withdrew from the garrison every
European that could be spared, a bare hundred men,
appeared at daybreak at his old position of Fakir's
Tope, and offered battle. The enemy declining to meet
him, he determined to attack them on the morrow.
The French camp fronted towards the north, extending
both east and west of the Sugar-loaf Rock. The Mahrattas
were encamped to the east, and the French close
to the west of the Sugar-loaf, while beyond the French
the Mysoreans prolonged the line westward almost to
the Golden Rock. The rear of the camp was covered
by jungle and rocky ground; the front of the French
quarters was protected by an entrenchment, as was also
that of the Mahratta camp; but along the rest of the
line the field-works, though marked out, were still
unfinished. The Golden Rock itself was held by one
hundred Europeans, six hundred Sepoys, and two companies
of native infantry, with two guns. The total
strength of the French forces would seem to have been
about six hundred Europeans, three thousand Sepoys,
and from twenty to thirty thousand Mahrattas and
Mysoreans, both horse and foot. Against them Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
could pit an equal number of Europeans, two
thousand Sepoys and three thousand Tanjorine horse.
The battle therefore, if won, must be won by the General.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">Sept. 21</span>
  <span class="blka over">Oct. 2.</span>
</span></div>

<p>The moon was shining brightly over the plain when
Lawrence's army fell into its ranks before the camp and
marched away in profound silence towards the Golden
Rock. The British battalion, five hundred strong, led
the van in column of three divisions, the grenadiers in
the front; while six field-guns, with a hundred British
artillerymen, were distributed equally on the flanks of
each division. In rear of the British followed the Sepoys
in two lines, and echeloned to the left rear of the Sepoys
rode the Tanjorine horse. The troops had not proceeded
far on the march when a heavy cloud floated
across the moon and shrouded the plain in darkness.
Still silently the columns pushed on through the gloom,
and the grenadiers drew closer and closer to the familiar
Rock which they had so often stormed; but no sign
came from the enemy, until at last, when they were
arrived within pistol shot, a challenge and a flash told
them that they were discovered. Firing one volley
they swarmed up the Rock on three sides at once, while
the French, having barely time to snatch up their arms,
emptied their muskets in a feeble, irregular fire, and
fled hurriedly down to the plain. Such was their haste
that they left their two field-guns undischarged, though
these were ready and loaded with grape. The left of
the French position being thus overpowered, Lawrence
ordered the Tanjorine horse to move up before the
French entrenchments; then wheeling his three divisions
into line to the left, he formed the Sepoys in
echelon in rear of each flank and ordered the whole to
advance through the Mysorean camp upon the left flank
of the French battalion. The men received the order
with loud cheers, and the troops stepped off, the drums
of the British beating the Grenadiers' March, the gunners
advancing with lighted port-fires on the flanks of the
divisions, and the Sepoys making wild music on their
native instruments in rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mysoreans fled in all directions before the din,
and the Sepoys kept up a constant fire on the swarms
of fugitives before them; but the British, disdaining
such ignoble game, marched proudly on with recovered
arms and bayonets fixed. But the formation of the
British was soon broken by the obstacles that confronted
them in that dark march through the Mysorean camp;
and presently the grenadiers, who kept the right of the
line, were striding away in their old place in the front,
having out-marched the second division, while the second
division in its turn out-marched the third. The Sepoys
having clear ground before them also came forward from
their places in rear, and the artillery being unable to
keep up was left to toil along as it might. Then broad
spurts of flame flashed out from the darkness in the
front, and the round shot from the French guns flew
humming overhead far away to the west, where wild
yells told that they had fallen among the hapless
Mysoreans, their own allies. Onward marched the
British, and soon the gleam of port-fires showed them
more clearly where their enemy stood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Astruc, perceiving by the flight of the
fugitives from what quarter the attack was coming, was
busy changing front to his left. His French battalion
had already been drawn up with its face to the west, and
two divisions, each of two thousand Sepoys, were hastening
into their positions to support it on either flank; but
in the darkness and confusion the division designed for
his right flank mistook its direction and took post on the
Sugar-loaf Rock. And now the dawn flushed up in the
east and showed the white coats of the French battalion
conspicuous in their line of battle, and the scarlet of the
British, not, as they should have been, in line, but broken
into echelon. The rear divisions quickened their pace
to align themselves with their comrades in front, but
before the formation could be completed the Sepoys on
their right came into action and swept the Sepoys
opposed to them off the ground with their very first
volley. Then at last, when within twenty yards of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
enemy, the British battalion got into line, while Astruc,
galloping backward and forward, repeated again and
again the order that not a French musket must be discharged
until the red-coats had fired. In the volleys
that followed, Captain Kilpatrick, who commanded the
grenadiers on the right, was desperately wounded; but
Caillaud, instantly taking his place, wheeled the grenadiers
round and fell upon the left flank of the French, which
had been uncovered by the flight of their Sepoys. A
crushing volley on this flank, followed by a charge with
the bayonet, drove the French left crowding upon its
centre, and a second deadly volley from the British
centre and left completed the discomfiture of the whole
line. Astruc strove in vain to rally his men; the
grenadiers pressing on with the bayonet gave them no
respite. Meanwhile also the British Sepoys on the left
had pushed on against the Sugar-loaf Rock and dispersed
the French Sepoys there, and the whole of the French
army fled scattered and in disorder towards Seringham.
Had the Tanjorine horse done its duty, the enemy would
have suffered past recovery, but as usual it was far too
busy with plunder to give a thought to pursuit. None
the less the losses of the French were heavy. Of their
Europeans a hundred were killed and wounded, and two
hundred more, together with Astruc and ten of his
officers, were taken prisoners; while the whole of their
tents, baggage and ammunition, and eleven guns
remained in Lawrence's hands. The loss of the British
amounted to no more than forty killed and wounded,
Lawrence himself being slightly hurt in the arm. So
ended his third and most important victory before
Trichinopoly.</p>

<p>On the very same evening Lawrence moved westward
to besiege the fortified post of Weycondah, which
was assaulted next day without orders by the Sepoys
and carried by the resolution of an English sergeant
belonging to one of their companies. Such was the
spirit which Lawrence had infused into them that they
emulated the exploits of King Harry's army after Agincourt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Being assured of abundance of supplies by his
victory, Lawrence now put his troops into cantonments
at Coilady for the rainy season, detaching four hundred
Sepoys and one hundred and fifty Europeans to strengthen
the garrison of Trichinopoly. At about the same time
Captain Dalton returned to Europe, resigning the command
of the city to Lieutenant Harrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">

</span></div>

<p>The French at Seringham being thoroughly cowed,
Dupleix resorted as usual to intrigue to regain his lost
ground, and by threats and promises contrived to detach
the Tanjorines from the British alliance. The next step
was to gain their active assistance for the French, and to
this end he strengthened the troops at Seringham by a
reinforcement of three hundred Europeans and matured
preparations for a blow, great and daring in conception,
which should neutralise all the successes of Lawrence;
namely to surprise and storm Trichinopoly by night.
On the morning of the 9th of December the attempt
was made, and was within an ace of success. Six
hundred Frenchmen escaladed the walls and surprised
and bayonetted the Sepoys on guard; and had they
obeyed their orders not to fire a shot, they must infallibly
have taken the city. But in the elation of their first
success they fired a volley which aroused the garrison.
Lieutenant Harrison, with perfect presence of mind,
made effective dispositions, and the attack was beaten
back with a loss to the French of forty Europeans killed
and nearly four hundred taken prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1754.</div>

<p>This reverse was a fatal blow to Dupleix, for, apart
from the loss of so large a body of Europeans, the King
of Tanjore determined to reject his overtures and
reverted to his original predilection for the British. At
the opening of 1754 therefore Dupleix approached
Governor Saunders with proposals for peace in the
Carnatic; for despite his misfortunes in the south he
had, thanks to the skill of Bussy, good compensation
in the spread of French influence in the northern
provinces of the Deccan. The negotiations, however,
soon broke down and the war was renewed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the position of Lawrence before Trichinopoly
was still, for all his victories, both anxious and
critical. Owing to the numbers of French prisoners in
the city he could muster but six hundred Europeans
and eighteen hundred Sepoys for service in the field;
whereas the enemy's European battalion was as strong
as his own, their Sepoys thrice as numerous, and the
Mahrattas and Mysoreans still with them in undiminished
strength. Moreover, in February a stroke of
good fortune revived the drooping spirits of the French.
A British convoy destined for Trichinopoly was attacked
by them and by their allies in overwhelming force and
captured, the whole of its escort being either killed or
wounded. This was by far the most serious reverse
suffered by the British during the whole course of the
war, for among the troops that were lost was the entire
company of grenadiers which had done such magnificent
service before Trichinopoly. This defeat greatly increased
Lawrence's difficulty in obtaining supplies. He
applied to the King of Tanjore for assistance in vain;
and having lost one-third of his Europeans and five
hundred Sepoys, his situation became perilous in the
extreme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
May <span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">12</span>
  <span class="blka over">23</span>
</span>.</div>

<p>A still greater misfortune followed. Lawrence
himself fell dangerously ill, and it was not until after
weeks of anxiety, by which time the army could hardly
hold its ground for want of supplies, that there came at
last a gleam of hope for the British. A convoy of stores
being expected, Captain Caillaud was sent southward on
the night of the 23rd of May with one hundred and
twenty Europeans, five hundred Sepoys, and two guns to
escort it into camp. The French having gained intelligence
beforehand of this movement, despatched double
that number of trained troops and guns, together with
four thousand picked Mysorean horse, to occupy the
position which Caillaud had designed for himself and to
lie there in wait for him. Fortunately Caillaud made
timely discovery of their whereabouts and decided to
attack them forthwith, which he did with success, driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
them from a tank in which they were posted and occupying
it himself. Not until the day broke did he realise the
odds against which he had fought in the darkness and the
numbers by which he was still menaced; but fortunately
the sound of the firing had been heard in Trichinopoly,
and Captain Polier, who commanded during Lawrence's
illness, at once started with every man that could be
spared to Caillaud's assistance. A French force started
at the same time with him to intercept him; but Polier
out-marching it, effected his junction with Caillaud
without mishap. The British force thus united amounted
to but three hundred and sixty Europeans and fifteen
hundred Sepoys, with five guns: the task that lay before
it was to fight its way back over the plain against
seven hundred Europeans, five thousand Sepoys, and ten
thousand horse, of which last fortunately none were
Mahrattas. Forming two sides of a square the little force
marched, not without loss but without serious molestation,
over a mile of the plain to a second tank; and
here the enemy closed round it, the Sepoys and cavalry
on three sides and the French battalion on the fourth.
But when the French advanced to the attack they were
met by a fire of grape which in a few minutes laid a
hundred of them on the ground and so staggered the
rest that they wavered and halted. "Never, I believe,"
says Lawrence, "were two field-pieces better served than
these." Caillaud, who was again in command owing
to the disabling of Polier by two wounds, seized the
moment to make a counter-attack, and the British poured
in so deadly a volley of musketry that the French gave
way and fled. Their officers exerted themselves to the
utmost to rally them, but they would not stop until
they were beyond range of cannon, nor even then would
they return to the attack. After this there was little
impediment to Caillaud's retreat. The loss of the
French amounted to five hundred killed and wounded,
of whom two hundred were Europeans; that of the
British slightly exceeded two hundred, of whom rather
more than a third were Europeans. Thus the much-needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
convoy was brought safely into camp; and the
French were not a little disheartened by their repulse.</p>

<p>Lawrence accordingly took the opportunity to
march into Tanjore, at once to confirm the vacillating
king in his allegiance and to pick up a slender reinforcement
which was waiting for him at Devicotah.
Thereupon the French as usual moved round to the
south side of Trichinopoly to cut off its supplies.
Fortunately the garrison had now provisions for three
months, for the Tanjorines, though quickly gained over
to the British side, showed no eagerness to give active
assistance; nor was it until the 17th of August that
Lawrence re-entered the plain of Trichinopoly with
twelve hundred Europeans, three thousand Sepoys, and
five thousand of his hardly won allies. For the fourth
time the French prepared to fight him, but would not
carry the action beyond a duel of artillery, wherein they
suffered much from the superiority of the British fire.
In a few days they were again shut up in Seringham; and
Lawrence went into cantonments for the rainy season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 11.<br />1755.</div>

<p>At this time a squadron arrived on the coast from
England under Admiral Watson, having on board the
Thirty-ninth Foot, a small party of the Royal Artillery,
and recruits for the Company's forces. The French
likewise received reinforcements from Europe; but
meanwhile they had lost the life and soul of their enterprise
in India. At the beginning of August Dupleix
was recalled to France, and three months later, in
accordance with orders received from London and
Paris, Governor Saunders and M. Godeheu, Dupleix's
successor, agreed to a suspension of arms, which in the
following January was expanded into a conditional
treaty. The revenue of the territory gained by France
during the war was computed at over eight hundred
thousand pounds; the gains of the English were set
down at less than a tenth of that sum. There could
be no question as to the side which had reaped the greater
advantage, thanks to the energy of Bussy and of Dupleix.</p>

<p>Yet Dupleix was now recalled; himself, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
indefatigable of intriguers, falling a victim to obscure
intrigues and jealousies at Versailles. This is no place
wherein to treat of the grandeur of his ambition, the
vast range of his designs, the incomparable adroitness
with which he handled native princes, the insight
with which he foresaw every danger, the constancy with
which he faced every reverse, the resource whereby he
repaired every misfortune, and the unfailing tenacity
with which he clung to his purpose. Excepting
Napoleon England has known no such dangerous and
uncompromising enemy, nor can it be said that he was
beaten even at the last. Yet after reading the story of
the long struggle for Trichinopoly, it is difficult to
believe that he would not have been beaten even had
he remained in India. His panegyrists complain, not
unjustly, that he was hampered by a dearth of able
subordinates. It would be nearer to the truth to say
that he was checked by an extraordinary abundance of
able British officers, not one of them bearing high rank;
by clerks such as Clive, by majors such as Lawrence,
by captains such as Dalton, Kilpatrick, and Caillaud,
lieutenants such as Harrison, ensigns such as Joseph
Smith. These were the men who thrust the cup of
success from his lips as often as he raised it to drink,
until his own countrymen finally dashed it from his
hand. And this is the true significance of our early
wars in India to the student of British military history&mdash;the
vast wealth of ability that lay, and doubtless still lies,
latent among the junior officers of the British Army.</p>

    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1506.<br />1535.<br />1608.</div>

<p class="noindent">From the East the course of our history leads us by
rapid transition to the great continent of the West. The
English claim to the sovereignty of North America
dated from the reign of Henry the Seventh, under
whose patronage Sebastian Cabot had made his great
discoveries; but it was the Spaniards who first approached
the unknown land and gave it the name of
Florida, and it was a Frenchman, Denis of Honfleur,
who first explored the Gulf of St. Lawrence. So also
it was a Frenchman, Jacques Cartier, who gave its name
to that noble river, and the name of Mount Royal or
Montreal to the hill on which the city now stands.
Full sixty years passed away before further attempt was
made to found European settlements on the North
American continent, and then English and French took
the work in hand well-nigh simultaneously. In 1603
De Monts obtained permission from the French king
to colonise Acadia,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> discovered and planted the harbour
called by him Port Royal and by the English at a later
date Annapolis Royal, and explored the coast southward
as far as that Plymouth where the Pilgrim Fathers
were to land in 1621. The attempt of De Monts was
a failure, and it was left to Samuel Champlain to begin
the work anew by the founding of Quebec and by the
establishment of Montreal at once as a gateway for
Indian trade and a bulwark against Indian invasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
To him was due the exploration of the river Richelieu
and of the lake which bears his name, as far as the two
headlands which were afterwards to become famous
under the names of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. In
Champlain's wake followed the Jesuit missionaries,
whose history presents so curious a mixture of that
which is highest and lowest in human nature. Lastly,
to Champlain must be ascribed not only the final settlement
of the French in Canada but the initiation of the
French policy of meddling with the internal politics of
the Indian tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1613.</div>

<p>Meanwhile an English Company of Adventurers
for Virginia had established a first settlement on the
James river, just three-and-twenty years after Raleigh's
abortive attempt to accomplish the same feat. The
rival nations had not been settled in North America
five years before they came into collision. The English
claimed the whole continent in virtue of Cabot's discoveries,
and the English Governor of Virginia enforced
the claim by sending a ship to Acadia, which demolished
the Jesuit settlement at Port Royal and carried the
settlers prisoners to Jamestown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1621.</div>

<p>A few years later a Scottish nobleman, Sir William
Alexander, afterwards Earl of Stirling, obtained a grant
from James the First of the territory which, in compliment
to his native land, he christened Nova Scotia, and
planted a colony there. Finally, in 1627, during the
war with France, a company of London merchants, inspired
chiefly by two brothers named Kirke, sent an
expedition up the St. Lawrence, which captured Quebec,
established settlements in Cape Breton, and in a word
made the conquest of Canada. Unfortunately, however,
Charles the First, then as always impecunious, allowed
these important acquisitions to be restored to France at
the Peace of 1632 for the paltry sum of fifty thousand
pounds. The conquering merchants protested but in
vain, pleading passionately for the retention at any rate
of Quebec. "If the King keep it," they wrote, "we do
not care what the French or any other can do, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they have an hundred sail of ships and ten thousand
men."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> So truly was appreciated, even in the seventeenth
century, the strategic value of that famous and
romantic fortress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1654.<br />1667.</div>

<p>Still even so Acadia<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> was not yet permanently lost,
for in 1654 Major Sedgwicke, who had been sent by
Cromwell to attack the Dutch settlements on the Hudson,
took the opportunity to capture the French ports at St.
Johns, Port Royal and Penobscot, and restored Acadia
to England once more. With England it remained
until 1667, when it was finally made over to France
by the Treaty of Breda. Thus was established the
French dominion in what is now called Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1621.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, in the same year as had seen the first
British settlement in Nova Scotia, English emigrants
had landed at New Plymouth and founded the New
England which was destined to swallow up New France.
King James granted the infant settlement a charter of
incorporation, encouraged it, and in 1625 declared by
proclamation that the territories of Virginia and New
England should form part of his empire.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> The next
step was the foundation of a distinct colony at Massachusetts
Bay in 1628, which was erected into a corporation
two years later and soon increased to a thousand
persons. In 1635 yet another settlement was formed
at Connecticut by emigrants from Massachusetts; and
in the same year the intolerance of his fellow-settlers in
Massachusetts drove Roger Williams afield to found
the colony of Rhode Island. Finally, in 1638, another
secession brought about the establishment of New
Haven. The settlers had left England, as they pleaded,
to find liberty of conscience; but as the majority understood
by this phrase no more than licence to coerce the
consciences of others, the few that really sought religious
liberty wandered far before they found it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1644.</div>

<p>A very few years sufficed to assure the preponderance
of Massachusetts in the Northern Colonies. It
widened its borders, absorbed the scattered settlements
of New Hampshire and Maine, and in 1644 took its
place at the head of the four federated colonies of New
England.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The distraction caused by the Civil War in
Britain left the colonies practically free from all control
by the mother country, and Massachusetts seized the
opportunity to erect a theocracy, which was utterly at
variance with the terms of her charter, and to assume,
together with the confederacy of New England, the airs
and privileges of an independent State. The ambitious
little community coined her own money, negotiated
with the French in Acadia without reference to England,
refused to trade with other colonies that were loyal to
the King's cause, resented the appointment by the Long
Parliament of Commissioners for the administration of
the colonies, and hinted to Cromwell that the side
which she might take in the Dutch war of 1653 would
depend entirely on the treatment which she might
receive from him. As her reward she received the
privilege of exemption from the restrictions of the
Navigation Acts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1660.<br />1684.</div>

<p>Then came the Restoration; and the confederacy
of New England quickly fell to pieces. Connecticut
received a separate charter, under which she absorbed
New Haven; and Rhode Island obtained a separate
charter likewise. Massachusetts being thus left isolated,
Charles the Second determined to inquire into the many
complaints made against her of violation of her charter.
The colonists replied by setting their militia in order as
if for armed resistance; but on reconsideration decided
to fall back on smooth words, false promises, false
statements, and skilful procrastination. Such methods
might seem at first sight to be misplaced in a community
of saints, such as Massachusetts boasted herself to be,
but at least they were never employed without previous
invocation of the Divine guidance. For twenty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the colonists contrived to keep the Royal authority at
arm's length, till at last, after long forbearance on the
side of Whitehall, the charter was cancelled by legal
process, and Massachusetts was restored to her dependence
on the mother country.</p>

<p>In the course of these years the English settlements
in North America had multiplied rapidly. Maryland
had been granted to Lord Baltimore in 1632; Carolina
was planted by a company in 1663; Delaware with New
Jersey was assigned by patent to the Duke of York,
afterwards James the Second, in 1664, and Pennsylvania
to William Penn in 1680. In fact, by the close of
Charles the Second's reign the British seaboard in North
America extended from the river St. Croix<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> in the
north to the river Savannah in the south. But of all
England's acquisitions during this period the most
momentous was that of the Dutch settlements on the
Hudson, captured in 1664 by Colonel Nicolls, who gave
to the town of New Amsterdam its now famous name
of New York.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> One chief advantage of New York
was that it possessed a direct way to the west from
Albany, on the Hudson, up the Mohawk River to Lake
Oneida and so to Lake Ontario, whereby it had access
to the great fur-trade with the Indians. But this consideration,
important though it was commercially, paled
before the strategical significance of the port of New
York. No more simple method of explaining this can
be found than to quote the belief held by many of the
English emigrants before they sailed, that New England
was an island. In a sense this is almost true, the country
being surrounded by the sea, to north, east, and
south, and by the rivers Hudson and St. Lawrence to the
west. Champlain had already paddled up the Richelieu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>to Lake Champlain with the design of passing through
Lake George, carrying his canoes to the head-waters of
the Hudson and re-embarking for a voyage down the
river to the sea. He had in fact chosen the highway of
lakes and rivers on which the principal battles for the
possession of the New World were to be fought. The
northern key of that highway was Quebec, the southern
New York. France possessed the one, and England
the other. The power that should hold both would
hold the whole continent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1670.<br />1673.<br />1678.<br />1680.</div>

<p>Let us now turn for a moment to the proceedings
of the French during these same years. Unlike the
English, who stuck sedulously to the work of making
their settlement self-supporting by agriculture, they were
intent rather on trading with the Indians for fur and
exploring the vast territory which lay to south and west
of them. To these objects may be added the salvation
of the souls of the Indian tribes; for beyond all doubt it
was zeal for the conversion, or at any rate for the baptism,
of these savages that led the Jesuits through endless
hardship and danger into the heart of the continent.
As early as 1613 Champlain had travelled up the Ottawa
by way of Lake Nipissing and French River to Lake
Huron, returning by Lake Simcoe and Lake Ontario.
Jesuit missionaries followed the same track in 1634, and
established a mission on the peninsula that juts out from
the eastern shore of Lake Huron. From thence they
spread to Lakes Superior and Michigan, erecting mission-houses
and taking possession of vast tracts of land
and water in the name of King Lewis the Fourteenth.
Shortly after the restoration of King Charles the Second,
Jean Talon, Intendant of Canada, formed the resolution
of getting in rear of the English settlements and confining
the settlers to a narrow strip of the sea-board; his
plan being to secure the rivers that formed the highways
of the interior, and to follow them, if they should prove
to flow thither, to the Gulf of Mexico, so as to hold
both British and Spaniards in check. A young adventurer,
named Robert Lasalle, appeared at the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
moment as a fit instrument to his hand. In 1670
Lasalle passed through the strait, still called Detroit,
which leads from Lake Huron to Lake Erie, reached a
branch of the Ohio and made his way for some distance
down that river. Three years later a Jesuit, Joliet,
striking westward from the western shore of Lake
Michigan, descended the Wisconsin and followed the
Mississippi to the junction of the Arkansas. In 1678
an expedition under Lasalle explored the passage from
Lake Ontario to Lake Erie, and discovered the Falls of
Niagara, where Lasalle, with immediate appreciation of
the strategic value of the position, proceeded to build a
fort. Finally, in 1680, Lasalle penetrated from the
present site of Chicago on Lake Michigan to the northern
branch of the River Illinois, paddled down to the Mississippi,
and after five months of travel debouched into the
Gulf of Mexico. He took nominal possession of all
the country through which he passed; and the vast
territory between the Alleghanies and the Rocky Mountains
from the Rio Grande and the Gulf of Mexico to
the uppermost waters of the Missouri were annexed to
the French crown under the name of Louisiana.</p>

<p>The next step was to secure the advantages that
should accrue from the discoveries of Lasalle. To this
end the fort at Niagara had already been built; and Fort
Frontenac was next erected at the northern outlet of
Lake Ontario to cut off the English from trade with
the Indians. At the strait of Michillimackinac, between
Lakes Huron and <ins class="corr" title="Errata&mdash;Original text: 'Erie'">Michigan</ins>, a Jesuit mission sufficiently
provided for the same object. Besides these there were
established Fort Miamis by the south-eastern shore of
Lake Michigan, to bar the passage from the lake to the
Upper Illinois, Fort St. Louis, near the present site of
Utica, to secure the trade with the tribes on the plains
of the Illinois, and yet another fort on the Lower Mississippi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1682.<br />1687.<br />1688.<br />1689.</div>

<p>Such a monopoly of the Indian trade was by no
means to the taste of the British and Dutch, nor of the
Five Indian Nations, better known by the French name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of Iroquois, whom they had taken under their special protection.
Nevertheless, in their simple plodding industry,
their zeal for religious controversy and their interminable
squabbles over their boundaries, the English colonies
took little heed to what was going on in the continent
behind them. One man alone saw the danger from the
first, namely, Colonel Thomas Dongan, an officer who
had begun his career in the French army, but had left
it for the British, and after some service at Tangier had
been sent out as Governor to New York. Dongan,
however, was at first unsupported either by the Government
at Whitehall or by the neighbouring colonies.
His protests were vigorous to discourtesy, but he had
small means for enforcing them. One resource indeed
he did possess, namely the friendship of the Iroquois,
who were the dominant tribes of the continent; for
with all their subtle policy and their passion for interference
with native affairs, the French had never succeeded
in alienating the Iroquois&mdash;who covered the flank
of New York and New England towards Canada&mdash;from
their alliance with the British. Dongan therefore assiduously
cultivated a good understanding with these Indians
against the moment when he should be allowed to act.
Meanwhile the French went yet further in aggression.
They destroyed the factories of the Hudson's Bay
Company; they treacherously entrapped and captured
a number of Iroquois at Fort Frontenac, plundered
English traders, and repaired and strengthened the fort
built by Lasalle at Niagara. Dongan's indignation rose
to a dangerous height; and now at last came a reply
from England to his previous reports, and an order to
repel further aggression on the Iroquois by force. Assembling
a force of local militia at Albany he first
insisted on the destruction of the fort at Niagara; and
then the Iroquois burst in upon Canada and spread
terror to the very gates of Montreal. It was just at
this crisis that William of Orange displaced James the
Second on the throne of England, and that war broke
out between England and France. Therewith New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
England and New France entered upon a conflict which
was to last with little intermission for the next seventy
years.</p>

<p>Judging from mere numbers the contest between the
rival colonies should have been short, for the population
of New England was over ninety thousand, whereas
that of Canada did not exceed twelve thousand. But
this disparity was more than equalised by other advantages
of the French. In the first place, they were compact,
united, and under command of one man, who was
an able and experienced soldier. In the second, a large
proportion of the inhabitants had undergone long
military training, the French king offering bounties
both of money and of land to officers and soldiers who
should consent to remain in the colony. The chief
delight of the male population was not the tilling of the
soil; they loved rather to hunt and fish, and live the
free and fascinating life of an Indian in the forest.
Every man therefore was a skilful woodsman, a good
marksman, a handy canoe-man, and in a word admirably
trained for forest-fighting. Finally, there was a
permanent garrison of regular troops, which never fell
below, and very often exceeded, fifteen hundred men.</p>

<p>The English settler, on the other hand, knew little
of the forest. When not engaged in husbandry he was
a fisherman in his native heritage, the sea. Every
colony had its own militia, which legally included, as a
rule, the whole male population between the ages of
sixteen and sixty. In the early days of North American
settlement the colonists had been at pains to bring with
them trained officers who could give them instruction
in the military art. Such an officer was Miles Standish,
who had served with the English troops in the Dutch
service; such another was Captain John Underhill, who
had fought in Ireland, Spain, and the Low Countries,
and was reputed a friend of Maurice of Nassau. Under
such leaders, in 1637, seventy-seven colonists had boldly
attacked an encampment of four hundred Indian warriors
and virtually annihilated them; giving, in fact, as fine an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
exposition of the principles of savage warfare as is to be
found in our history.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> In 1653 again, New England,
once assured of Cromwell's favour, made great and
expensive preparations for an attack on the Dutch; and
Massachusetts supplied two hundred volunteers to
Nicolls for the capture of New York in 1664.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1680.<br />1686.</div>

<p>But as time went on the military efficiency of the
colonies decreased; and in the war against the Indian
chief, Philip, in 1671, the settlers suffered disaster upon
disaster. The officers possessed neither skill nor
knowledge; and the men, though they showed no lack
of bravery and tenacity, were wholly innocent of
discipline. Moreover, they shared the failing of the
English militia of the same period, that they were
unwilling to go far from their own homes. Again,
since the confederacy of New England had been broken
up, the jealousy and selfishness of the several provinces
had weakened them for military efficiency. In the
great peril of 1671 Rhode Island, being full of Quakers,
would not move a finger to help her neighbours, and
Connecticut, exasperated by extreme provocation, actually
armed herself a few years later to inflict punishment on
the cantankerous little community.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Within the several
provinces again there was no great unanimity, and in
fact in the event of a war with France every advantage
of skill, of unity, and of prompt and rapid action lay
with the French. James the Second, who saw the peril
of the situation, tried hard to mend matters during his
brief reign by uniting New England, New York, and
New Jersey under the rule of a single governor, Sir
Edmund Andros, an officer of the Guards. The
experiment from one point of view was statesmanlike
enough, but as it could not be tried without abolishing
the representative assemblies of the various states, it
defeated its own object by its extreme unpopularity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The military aid furnished to the American colonies
from home throughout this early period was infinitesimal.
New England had never appealed to the
mother country for help even in her utmost need. An
independent company of regular troops was formed for
the garrison of New York while the Duke of York was
proprietor, and another company was also maintained
for a short time in Virginia; but the first troops of the
standing army to visit America were a mixed battalion
of the First and Coldstream Guards, which crossed the
Atlantic to suppress the Virginian rebellion of 1677.
When Andros assumed his government in 1686 he
brought with him a second company of soldiers from
England. These were the first red-coats ever seen in
Boston, and they have the credit of having taught New
England to "drab, drink, blaspheme, curse and damn,"
a lesson which, as I understand, has not been forgotten.
Thus though the militia of the colonies under Andros
might muster a nominal total of ten or twelve thousand
men, these two companies were all that he could have
brought to meet the thirty-two or more companies of
regular troops in Montreal and Quebec.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689.</div>

<p>The outbreak of the war in 1689 brought back an
efficient soldier, Count Frontenac, to the government of
Canada. He knew the country well, having already
served there as Governor from 1672 to 1682, and in
that capacity seconded the great designs of Lasalle.
On his arrival he at once made preparations for an
advance on Albany by Lakes Champlain and George
and for a rapid movement against New York. The
project fortunately issued in no more than a general
massacre of the inhabitants on the northern frontier of
New York; but when that province called in alarm
upon New England for assistance, it was found that
Massachusetts had risen in revolution at the news of
King James's fall, had imprisoned Andros, and through
sheer perversity had cancelled all his military dispositions
for the protection of New Hampshire and
Maine. The Indians accordingly swept down upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
defenceless borders and made frightful havoc with fire
and sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690.<br />1691.</div>

<p>In the following year the colonies of New York and
New England met in congress and agreed to make a
counter-stroke against Canada. More remarkable still,
Massachusetts for the first time appealed to England
for military aid in the furtherance of this enterprise;
though, as may be guessed by those who have followed
me through the story of King William's difficulties,
the appeal was perforce rejected. The colonies therefore
resolved to act alone, and despatched fifteen
hundred troops by the usual line of inland waterways
against Montreal, and thirty-two ships under Sir William
Phips against Quebec. The expedition by land soon
broke down on its way through dissension, indiscipline,
and disease; and the fleet, though it made an easy
conquest of Acadia, failed miserably before Quebec.
The next year a small force from New York made a
second futile raid into Canada; but for the most part
the English colonies were content to hound on their
Indian allies against the French. The French on their
side retaliated in kind, and, as circumstances gave them
opportunity, with still greater barbarity. Hundreds of
defenceless settlers on the border were thus slaughtered
without the slightest military advantage. Frontenac
wrote repeated letters to his master urging him to
determine the possession of the continent once for all
by sending a fleet to capture New York; but either
Lewis's hands were too full or he failed to appreciate
the wisdom of Frontenac's counsel, for in any case,
fortunately, he left New York unmolested.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697.</div>

<p>The sphere of operations widened itself over Acadia
and Newfoundland, and the war dragged on in a
desultory fashion with raid and counter-raid, generally
to the advantage of the French. To the last the
English colonies were blind to the importance of the
issue at stake. Jealous, self-centred, and undisciplined,
many of them took no part whatever in the war; two
only, New England and New York, rose to aggressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
action, which, though the stroke was wisely aimed
against the tap-root of French power, failed utterly
from lack of organisation and discipline. The French
struck always at strategic points where their blow would
tell with full force and weight. The colonists in their
insane jealousy of the crown neglected the defence of
these strategic points simply because it was enjoined by
the mother country, and refused to provide the contingents
of troops requested by the English commander-in-chief.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
In fine, when the Peace of Ryswick ended
the war, the French could reckon that they had achieved
one great success; they had broken the power of the
most formidable of the Indians, the Iroquois.</p>

<p>Massachusetts, which had suffered heavily from the
war, found herself at its close obliged once more to
invoke the assistance of England. In an address to
the King she prayed for his orders to the several
colonial governments to give their assistance against
French and Indians, for a supply of ammunition, for the
protection of a fleet, and for aid in the reduction of
Canada, "the unhappy fountain," as they wrote, "from
which issue all our miseries." So far, therefore, the
war had taught one useful lesson; but, indeed, even at
the time of her greatest disloyalty to the English crown
Massachusetts had always soundly hated the French.
Obviously closer union of the colonies for military
purposes could not but be for the general advantage,
and sundry schemes were prepared to promote it; but
all alike were unsuccessful, though nothing could be
more certain than that further trouble was ahead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702.<br />1707.<br />1709.</div>

<p>The renewal of war in 1702 brought the usual raids
of Indians, stirred up by the French, upon the borders
of the English colonies. These barbarous inroads, which
meant the massacre and torture of innocent settlers,
could serve no military end except to commit the Indians
to hostility with the English, and naturally aroused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
fiercest resentment. The colonies, however, once again
showed neither unity nor zeal for the common cause.
New York evinced an apathy which was little short of
criminal, Connecticut long held aloof, Rhode Island
only after infinite haggling supplied grudging instalments
of men and money. Massachusetts alone, true to her
traditions, showed some vigour and spirit and actually
made an attack on Port Royal in Acadia, choosing that
point because it could be reached by sea. The expedition,
however, failed with more than usual discredit
owing to ignorance and unskilfulness in the commanders
and utter indiscipline among the troops. Then the
colonies wisely decided that it was useless to attempt to
choke the fountain of all their miseries except at its
head. An address was sent to Queen Anne praying for
help in the conquest of Nova Scotia and Canada, which
was favourably received; and for the first time operations
were concerted for a joint attack of imperial and
colonial troops upon the French in North America.
England was to supply a fleet and five regiments of the
regular Army, Massachusetts and Rhode Island were to
furnish twelve hundred men more, and these forces
united were to attempt Quebec; while fifteen hundred
men from the other colonies, except from New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, which selfishly kept apart, were to advance
upon Montreal by Lake Champlain. The troops of
Massachusetts were mustered and drilled by British
officers sent across the Atlantic for the purpose, and all
signs pointed to a great and decisive effort. In due
time the western contingent advanced towards Lake
Champlain, by way of Albany and the Hudson, building
on their way a fort at the carrying-place from the
Hudson, which we shall know better as Fort Edward,
and a second fort at Wood Creek, where the journey by
water to Lake George was recommenced, called Fort
Anne. There the little column halted, for the brunt
of the work was to fall on the fleet which was expected
from England. The weeks flew on, but the fleet
never appeared. The disaster of Almanza had upset all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
calculations and disconcerted all arrangements; and the
great enterprise was perforce abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710.<br />1711.</div>

<p>In July of the following year, however, an expedition
on a smaller scale met with more success. A joint
fleet of the Royal Navy and of colonial vessels, together
with four regiments from New England and one of
British marines, sailed against Port Royal, captured it
after a trifling resistance, and changed its name to that
which it still bears, of Annapolis Royal. Nova Scotia
had changed hands many times, but from henceforth it
was to remain British. Thus for the first time a British
armament interposed seriously in the long strife between
French and English in America. It was the beginning
of the end, and of the end of more than French rule
over the continent. "If the French colonies should
fall," wrote a French officer at the time, "Old England
will not imagine that these various provinces will then
unite, shake off the yoke of the English monarchy, and
erect themselves into a democracy."<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> The idea of the
capture of Canada, however, took root just at this time
in the new English Ministry, where Bolingbroke and
Harley had succeeded in ousting Marlborough from
office. The conquest of New France would, they conceived,
be a fine exploit to set off against the victories
of the great Duke. Massachusetts seconded the project
with extraordinary zeal, and in July 1711 a British fleet
with seven regular regiments on board sailed into Boston
harbour. The disastrous issue of this enterprise has
already been told. Bad seamanship cast eight of the
transports on the rocks in the St. Lawrence, and seven
hundred soldiers were drowned. General Hill and
Admiral Walker were not the men to persist in the
face of such a mishap, and the whole design was abandoned
with disgraceful alacrity. The expedition was in
fact simply a political move, conceived by factious
politicians for factious ends instead of by military men
for the benefit of the country, and accordingly it fared
as such expeditions must inevitably fare.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1713.</div>

<p>Finally came the Peace of Utrecht, which gave
England permanent possession of Newfoundland and of
Acadia, though still without settlement of the vexed
question as to the boundaries of the ceded province.
These acquisitions entailed an increase of the British
garrisons in America, as has already been told; but the
entire strength of the British regular troops in New
York, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland did not exceed
nine hundred men. The French, for their part, after
the loss of Acadia betook themselves to Cape Breton, or,
as they called it, L'Ile Royale, and set themselves forthwith
to establish in one of the harbours a post which
should command the access to Canada, and form a base
for future aggression against New England and Nova
Scotia. A haven, named Port à l'Anglais, on the east
coast was selected, and there was built the fort of Louisburg,
the strongest on the Atlantic coast, and as the
French loved to call it, the Dunkirk of America. The
establishment of this fortress was one of those costly
follies to which the French are prone, when failure and
defeat allow them no outlet for their vexation and their
spite. The climate absolutely forbade the construction
of an elaborate stronghold of masonry. Fog and rain
prevented mortar from setting all through the short
spring and summer, fog and frost split mortar and
stones and demolished walls every winter. Repairs
were endless, yet the fortress was never in good repair,
and the expense was intolerable. Lastly, such a stronghold
was worthless without supremacy at sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1724.</div>

<p>But the French did not stop here. They lost no
opportunity of stirring up the Acadians to discontent
and of inflaming the Indians against the British both in
Acadia and in New England. The result was a series of
raids on the Kennebec, where the French, in order to
guard the line of advance on Quebec by that river and
Lake Chaudière, had established a chain of mission-stations.
The colonists, goaded to exasperation, at last
rooted out these missions by force, though not until
after long delay owing to the perversity of the Assembly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of Massachusetts, which, always jealous of the English
Governor, wished to take the control of operations out
of his hand into their own, never doubting that their
rustic ignorance would be as efficient as the tried skill
of one of Marlborough's veterans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727.</div>

<p>So this state of outward peace and of covert war
continued. France, despite the concessions made at the
Peace of Utrecht, still claimed the whole of the North
American continent, with some few trifling exceptions,
and took every measure to make good her claim. A
new fort was erected at Niagara; another fort was built
at Chambly to cover Montreal from any English attack
by way of Lake Champlain, and in 1731 a massive
stronghold of masonry was constructed at Crown Point,
on the western shore of the same lake, and christened
Fort Frédéric. The ground on which this last fort
stood was within the bounds claimed by New York,
but the province was too busy over quarrels with her
neighbour, New Jersey, to interpose. So although New
York and New England alike denounced the encroachment
furiously, neither the one nor the other would lift
a finger to prevent it. The one movement made by
the colonists in counterpoise to the ceaseless activity of
the French was the establishment of a fortified trading
station at Oswego on Lake Ontario, as a rival to the
French post at Niagara. Even this work was done not
by the colonists but by Governor Burnet of New York
at his own expense; and the debt due to him from the
province on this account has never been liquidated to
this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744.<br />1745.<br />June 17.</div>

<p>Thus matters drifted on until the war of the Austrian
Succession. Then, as usual, the French at Louisburg
received warning of the outbreak before the English at
Boston, and the imperial garrisons at Annapolis Royal
and at Canseau were overpowered and captured by the
French without an effort. But now the colonists with
superb audacity resolved to take the bull by the horns
and to attack the French in the most formidable of their
strongholds, Louisburg itself. The moving spirit in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the enterprise was Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts,
an Englishman by nationality and a barrister
by training, who thought himself a born strategist; and
the commander whom he selected was one William
Pepperrell, a prosperous merchant of New England,
whose father had emigrated as a poor man from his
native Devon and had made his fortune. Pepperrell
had neither education nor experience in military matters,
but he had shrewd good sense; while, being popular, he
was likely to command the respect and obedience of his
undisciplined troops. After some trouble the Provincial
Assemblies were coaxed into approval of the design;
four thousand men were raised in New England, a small
fleet of armed vessels was collected for the protection of
the transports, and the little expedition sailed to its
rendezvous at Canseau, some fifty miles from Louisburg.
Here by good luck it was joined by a British
squadron under Commodore Warren, which threw in its
lot with it; and the army of amateurs with its escort
of hardy seamen proceeded with a light heart to the
siege of the Dunkirk of America. The account of the
operations is laughable in the extreme, though the French
found them no matter for laughter. Skilled engineers
the besiegers had none, and few if any skilled artillerymen,
but they went to work with the best of spirits and
good humour in their own casual fashion, which puzzled
the French far more than a regular siege in form. To
be brief, with the help of gunners from the fleet and of
extraordinary good fortune they succeeded in capturing
the fortress after a siege of six weeks. The performance
is certainly one of the curiosities of military history,
but must be passed over in this place since it forms no
part of the story of the British Army.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The colonists
were not a little proud of the feat, and with right good
reason. Nor did their gallant efforts pass without
recognition in England. Pepperrell, who had amply
justified Shirley's choice, was created a baronet; and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
Warren's suggestion<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> the remains of the colonial troops
were taken into English pay and formed into two regiments,
with Pepperrell and Shirley for their colonels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746.</div>

<p>Though the colonial garrison suffered terribly from
pestilence during the ensuing winter,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Shirley was anxious
to complete the conquest of Canada in 1746; and
Newcastle received his proposals with encouragement at
Whitehall. Three British regiments&mdash;the Twenty-ninth,
Thirtieth, and Forty-fifth&mdash;arrived in April to occupy
Louisburg, and Newcastle promised five battalions more
under Lieutenant-General St. Clair, together with a fleet
under Warren, to aid in the operations. It was agreed
that the British and the levies of New England should
sail up the St. Lawrence to attack Quebec, while the
remainder should, as usual, march against Montreal by
way of Lake Champlain. The colonists took up the
enterprise with great spirit, and the Provincial Assemblies
of seven colonies voted a total force of forty-three
hundred men. The French in Canada took the alarm
and made frantic preparations for defence; but though
the colonists were ready and eager at the time appointed,
the British troops never appeared; Newcastle having
detained them in Europe for the ridiculous descent,
already described elsewhere, upon L'Orient. Shirley,
undismayed, then decided to turn his little force against
Crown Point; when all New England was alarmed by
intelligence of a vast French armament on its way to
retake Louisburg, recapture Acadia and burn Boston.
Then the colonists took fright in their turn and
equipped themselves for defence with desperate energy;
but once again there was no occasion for panic. The
French fleet sailed indeed, but after a voyage of disasters
reached the coast of Nova Scotia only to be shattered
and dispersed by a terrible storm. The Commander-in-Chief
died of a broken heart, his successor threw
himself on his own sword in despair, and after some
weeks of helpless lingering in the harbour which now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>bears the name of Halifax, the fragments of the French
fleet returned almost in a state of starvation to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747.</div>

<p>Not discouraged by this terrible reverse the French
Government in the following year sent out a second
fleet, which was met off Rochelle by a superior fleet
under Admirals Anson and Warren and utterly defeated.
It was fortunate, for the British Government with
Newcastle at its head gave the Americans no further
help. Three hundred soldiers were indeed shipped off
to Annapolis, but more than half of them died on the
voyage, and many of the remainder, being gaol-birds
and Irish papists, deserted to the French. The situation
in Acadia was perilous, for the French population did
not love their new masters, and the Canadians, particularly
the Jesuit priests, never ceased to stimulate them
to revolt. Shirley resolved that, though the security
of Acadia was the charge of the mother country, the
colonists must protect the province for themselves
sooner than abandon it. Massachusetts responded to
his appeal with her usual spirit, and notwithstanding one
severe reverse of the colonial troops, Acadia was still
safe at the close of the war. For the rest, the French
pursued their old method of hounding on the Indians
against the British; and petty but barbarous warfare
never ceased on the borders. For once, too, this
warfare produced, though indirectly, an important
result, since it brought to the front a young Irishman
named William Johnson who, having shown an extraordinary
power and ascendency over the Indians, was
chosen as agent for New York in all dealings of the
British with them. We shall see more of this Johnson
in the years before us. Finally came the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
when the Americans to their huge disgust
learned that Louisburg, their own prize, had been
restored to France&mdash;bartered away for the retention of
an insignificant factory called Madras.</p>

    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1748.</div>

<p class="noindent">The conclusion of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was
followed by the usual reduction of the forces in Britain.
The ten new regiments and several other corps were
disbanded, leaving for the cavalry all the regiments now
in the Army List down to the Fourteenth Hussars, and in
the infantry the Foot Guards and the First to the Forty-ninth
Regiments of the Line. The strength of all corps
was of course diminished and the British Establishment
was fixed at thirty thousand men, two-thirds of them
for service at home and one-third for colonial garrisons.
The rest of the Army, thirty-seven regiments in all, but
very weak in numbers, was as usual turned over to the
Irish Establishment. Efforts were of course made in
both Houses of Parliament to cut down the numbers
of the Army to a still lower figure, and the antiquated
arguments in favour of such a step were repeated as
though they had not already done duty a thousand
times within the past forty years. Nay, so vigorous
is the old age of folly and of faction that men were still
found, when the Mutiny Act was brought forward, to
urge the needlessness of courts-martial in time of peace.
These childish representations, however, received little
notice or encouragement; while, on the other hand,
divers projects for reform in the Army were brought
forward which, even though they led to no result,
received at least careful attention and intelligent debate.
Of these matters it will be more convenient to speak
when the narrative of the war is concluded. For
although peace had been proclaimed, and estimates and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
establishment had been accordingly reduced, the struggle
with France, far from being closed, was not even
suspended abroad. It would seem that not a few
members of both Houses were alive to the fact; while
fugitive notices in the newspapers, announcing that
"Mr. Clive, a volunteer, had the command given to
him to attack a place called Arcourt," may have
suggested it even to the gossips of the coffee-houses.
The Government, however, was not one which could
be expected to take thought for the morrow, or indeed
for anything beyond the retention of power. It was
that Administration which had been formed by Henry
Pelham in 1744, and is generally identified with the
name of his brother, the Duke of Newcastle, who is
remembered chiefly through his ignorance of the fact
that Cape Breton is an island. This deplorable person
possessed no talent beyond an infinite capacity for such
intrigue as lifts incompetence to high office, and was
only less of a curse to England than Madame de Pompadour
was to France. One able man, however, there
was in the lower ranks of the Administration, William
Pitt, who, after a vain effort to become Secretary at
War, had accepted the post of Paymaster of the Forces.
He now lay quiet, though not without occasional outbursts
of mutiny, abiding his time and fulfilling the
duties of his place with an integrity heretofore unknown
in the Paymaster's Office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749.</div>

<p>One important military measure, meanwhile, the
Government did take. The number of men disbanded
from fleet and army was so large that it was deemed
prudent, in the interests alike of humanity and of public
security, to make some provision for them. Accordingly
fifty acres of freehold land, with an additional ten
acres for every child, were offered to all veterans who
would emigrate as settlers to Nova Scotia; their passage
outward being likewise paid, and immunity from taxation
guaranteed to them for ten years. The system was
copied from the model given by the French in Canada,
and by them doubtless borrowed from ancient Rome;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
but it was successful. Four thousand persons, with
their families, took advantage of the offer, embarked
under the command of Colonel Cornwallis and landed
at the harbour of Chebucto, from thenceforward called,
in honour of the President of the Board of Trade and
Plantations, by the name of Halifax. Three companies
of rangers were formed for the defence of the settlement,
in addition to which two battalions of regular
troops were detailed for the garrisons of Nova Scotia
and Newfoundland. For it was intended that Halifax
should be not only a refuge for disbanded soldiers, but
a fortified station in counterpoise to the French fortress
at Louisburg.</p>

<p>The French in Canada instantly took the alarm, and
after their unscrupulous manner incited the Indians
to murder the settlers, sparing no pains meanwhile to
alienate the hearts of the Acadians from the British.
The priests were their instruments in this treacherous
policy, and their proceedings were fully approved at
Versailles. What was called an Indian war was, in the
plain words of Governor Hopson of Nova Scotia, no
other than a pretence for the French to commit hostilities
on British subjects. Yet through the trying years
that followed, the British officials behaved always with
exemplary patience and forbearance, though, owing to
the incessant intrigues of the French, occasional skirmishes
between French and English were unavoidable.
But British settlers had touched French America elsewhere
on a more tender point even than in Acadia.
British traders had found their way across the Alleghanies
to the Ohio, and had stolen the hearts of the Indians on
the river from their French rivals. To Canada this
was a serious matter, for the chain of French posts that
was designed to shut off the British from the interior
ran from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Gulf of
Mexico, and if the British should sever this chain at the
Ohio French America would be parted in twain. In
1749 a French emissary was despatched from Montreal
to vindicate French rights on the river and to bid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
English traders depart from it. His reception by the
Indians was not encouraging, and even while he was on
the spot a company was formed by some capitalists in
Virginia to settle the country about the Ohio. The
Governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia quickly perceived
the importance of the position on the fork of the
river where Pittsburg now stands, and were anxious to
secure it by a fortified station; but unfortunately the
public spirit of the colonies was less intelligent than the
private enterprise. The Provincial Assemblies quarrelled
with their governors and with each other, and refused to
vote a farthing either for building a fort or for presents
to conciliate the Indians in the valley of the Ohio.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1752-1753.</div>

<p>Then, as usual, while the colonies debated and postponed
the French took prompt and decisive action. In
the summer of 1752 a new Governor, Duquêsne, had
arrived in Canada, who, as soon as the spring of 1753 was
come, sent an expedition of fifteen hundred men through
Lake Ontario to Lake Erie, where they landed on the
eastern shore and built a fort of logs at Presquile, the site
of the present Erie. Thence cutting a road for several
leagues southward to French Creek (then called Rivière
aux Bœufs), they constructed there a second fort named
Fort le Bœuf, from which, when the water was high,
they could launch their canoes on the creek and follow
the stream downward to the Alleghany and the Ohio.
The expedition was to have built a third fort at the
junction of French Creek and the Alleghany, and
descended the Ohio in order to intimidate the Indians,
but the project was defeated by the sickliness of the
troops. Garrisons were therefore left at Fort le Bœuf
and Presquile, and the remainder of the force returned
to Montreal, having thus secured communications between
the St. Lawrence and the Ohio.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1753.<br />Dec. 11.</div>

<p>Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia no sooner heard of
this movement on the part of the French than he sent a
summons to the commanders of the forts to withdraw
forthwith from the King of England's territory. The
bearer of the message was the Adjutant-General of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Virginian militia, a young man of twenty-one with a
great destiny before him, George Washington. There
were two British trading stations on the Ohio, Venango,
at the junction of French Creek and the Alleghany, and
Logstown, some miles below the site of Pittsburg. On
arriving at Venango, Washington found it converted
into a French military station, the officers of which
received him hospitably, but told him that they had
orders to take possession of the Ohio, and that "by God
they would do it." Making his way from thence to
Fort le Bœuf, Washington delivered Dinwiddie's letter,
and returned with the reply that it should be forwarded
to Montreal, but that the garrisons had no intention of
moving until orders should arrive from thence. Dinwiddie
meanwhile had again appealed to the Virginian
Assembly to vote money to build forts on the Ohio.
He could show a letter from the Board of Ordnance in
England approving of the project and offering arms
and ammunition, as well as a letter from the King
authorising the execution of the work at the colony's
expense and the repelling of force by force; but the
Assembly, though alive to the danger, would not vote a
sixpence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1754.<br />February.</div>

<p>Such obstinacy was enough to drive a Governor to
despair, but Dinwiddie was blessed with considerable
tenacity of purpose. A renewal of his appeal in the
ensuing session was more successful, and the Assembly
grudgingly voted a small and insufficient sum, with
which the Governor was forced to be content. Urgent
applications to the neighbouring colonies for aid met
with little response. The remoter provinces thought
themselves in no way concerned; those nearer at hand
refused help chiefly because their governors asked for
it. It was in fact a principle with the Provincial Assemblies
to thwart their governor, whether he were right
or wrong, on every possible occasion; they being, as is
so common in representative bodies, more anxious to
assert their power and independence than their utility
and good sense. North Carolina alone granted money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
enough for three or four hundred men. However, the
British Government had sanctioned the employment of
the regular companies at New York and in Carolina,
and Dinwiddie having raised three hundred men in
Virginia, ordered them to the Ohio Company's station
at Will's Creek, which was to be the base of operations.
Meanwhile he despatched a party of backwoodsmen
forthwith to the forks of the Ohio, there to build, on a
site selected by Washington, the fort for which he had
pleaded so long. Forty men were actually at work
upon it when, on the 17th of April, a flotilla of small
craft came pouring down on the Alleghany with a
party of five hundred French on board. The troops
landed, trained cannon on the unfinished stockade, and
summoned the British to surrender. Resistance was
hopeless. The backwoodsmen perforce yielded; and
the French having demolished their works erected a
much larger and better fort on the same site, and called
it Fort Duquêsne. The name before long was to be
altered to Pittsburg, but the change was as yet hidden
behind the veil of years. For the present the French
had stolen a march on the British, and Dinwiddie was
chagrined to the heart. "If the Assembly had voted
the money in November which they did in February,"
he wrote, "the fort would have been built and
garrisoned before the French approached."</p>

<p>The Governor, however, was by no means disposed
meekly to accept this defeat. The French had expelled
a British party from British territory by force of arms,
and both he and Washington treated the incident as
equivalent to a declaration of war. Washington,
though but half of his troops had yet joined him,
presently advanced over the Alleghanies to the
Youghiogany, a tributary of the Monongahela; and
there on the 27th of May he came upon a small party
of French and fired the shots which began the war.
A few weeks later he with his little force, something
less than four hundred men, was surrounded by twice
that number of Frenchmen, and after a fight of nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
hours and the loss of a fourth of his men, was compelled
to capitulate.</p>

<p>Dinwiddie was vexed beyond measure by this second
reverse, and by the delay in the arrival of the reinforcements
which had caused it. The two companies of
regular troops from New York came crawling up to
the scene of action in a disgraceful state. Their ranks
were thin, for their muster-rolls had been falsified by
means of "faggots"; they were undisciplined; they
had neither tents, blankets, knapsacks, nor ammunition
with them, nothing, in fact, but their arms and thirty
women and children.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The troops from North Carolina
were still worse than these in the matter of discipline,
so much so that they mutinied and dispersed to their
homes while yet on the march to the rendezvous. The
peril was great; yet the colonies remained supine. The
Assembly of Virginia only after a bitter struggle granted
Dinwiddie a competent sum; that of Pennsylvania,
being composed chiefly of Quakers and of German
settlers, who were anxious only to live in peace and to
cultivate their farms, refused practically to contribute
a farthing. New York was unable to understand,
until Washington had been actually defeated, that there
had been any French encroachment on British territory;
Maryland produced a contribution only after long
delay; and New Jersey, safely ensconced behind the
shelter of her neighbours, flatly declined to give any
aid whatever. New England alone, led as usual by
Massachusetts, showed not only willingness but alacrity
to drive back the detested French. United action was
as yet inconceivable by the colonists or, as the English
more correctly called them, the Provincials. It was
only in deference to representations from the British
Government that New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland,
and the four colonies of New England met in congress
to concert for joint action in securing the unstable
affections of the Indians. A project for colonial union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
broached by Benjamin Franklin at this same congress
was wrecked by the jealousy of Crown and Colonies as
to mutual concession of power.</p>

<div class="sidenote">September.</div>

<p>In such circumstances the only hope lay in assistance
from the mother country; and Dinwiddie accordingly
sent repeated entreaties to England for stores, ammunition,
and two regiments of regular infantry. The
Ministry at home was not of a kind to cope with a
great crisis. Henry Pelham was dead; and the
ridiculous Newcastle as Prime Minister had succeeded
in finding a fool still greater than himself, Sir T.
Robinson, to be Secretary of State in charge of the
colonies. Nevertheless, in July ten thousand pounds
in specie and two thousand stand of arms were shipped
for the service of the colonies,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and on the 30th of
September orders were issued for the Forty-fourth and
Forty-eighth regiments, both of them on the Irish
Establishment, to be embarked at Cork. Each of these
regiments was appointed to consist of three hundred
and forty men only, and to take with it seven hundred
stand of arms, so as to make up its numbers with
American recruits.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> But the nucleus of British soldiers
was presently increased to five hundred men, the
augmentation being effected, as usual, by drafts from
other regiments; not, however, without difficulty, for
the service was unpopular, and there was consequently
much desertion. The next step was to appoint a commander;
and the choice fell upon General Edward
Braddock, sometime of the Coldstream Guards. He
was a man of the same stamp as Hawley, and therefore
after the Duke of Cumberland's own heart,&mdash;an officer
of forty-five years' service, rough, brutal,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and insolent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>a martinet of the narrowest type, but wanting neither
spirit nor ability, and brave as a lion. His instructions
were sufficiently wide, comprehending operations against
the French in four different quarters. The French
were to be driven from the Ohio, and a garrison was to
be left to hold the country when captured; the like
was to be done at Niagara, at Crown Point, and at Fort
Beauséjour, a work erected by the French on the
isthmus that joins Nova Scotia to the Continent. This
plan had been suggested by Governor Shirley of
Massachusetts; and in furtherance thereof the British
Government had ordered two regiments, each one
thousand strong, to be raised in America under the
colonelcy of the veterans Shirley and Pepperrell, and to
be taken into the pay of Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> There might
well be doubt whether the means provided would suffice
for the execution of the scheme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755.<br />April.</div>

<p>It was January 1755 before the Forty-fourth and
Forty-eighth were embarked at Cork, and past the
middle of March before the whole of the transports
arrived in Hampton Roads. Good care seems to have
been taken of the troops on the voyage, for Braddock
was able to report that there was not a sick man among
them.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The transports were ordered to ascend the
Potomac to Alexandria, where a camp was to be
formed; and there on the 14th of April several of the
governors met Braddock in council to decide as to the
distribution of the work that lay before them. All was
soon settled. Braddock with the two newly arrived
regiments was to advance on Fort Duquêsne; Shirley
with his own and Pepperrell's regiments was to attack
Niagara; William Johnson, on account of his influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>with the Indians, was chosen to lead a body of Provincial
troops from New England, New Jersey, and New York
against Crown Point; and to Lieutenant-Colonel
Monckton, an officer of whom we shall hear more, was
entrusted the task of overpowering Fort Beauséjour.
The first and second of these operations were designed
to cut the chain of French posts between the St.
Lawrence and the Ohio, and may be described as purely
offensive. Why, however, it should have been thought
necessary to sever this chain at two points when one
point would have sufficed, and why therefore the whole
strength of the blow was not aimed at Niagara, are
questions not easily to be answered. The capture of
Crown Point would serve alike to bar a French advance
southward at Lake Champlain and to further a British
advance on Montreal, and hence combined objects both
offensive and defensive. The reduction of Fort Beauséjour
having no other purpose than the security of
Acadia, was a measure wholly defensive.</p>

<p>The Council broke up; the commanders repaired
to their several charges, and Braddock was left to cope
with his task. A great initial blunder had been made
by the military authorities in England in sending the
troops to Virginia and ordering them to advance on the
Ohio by the circuitous route from Wills' Creek. This
was, it is true, the line that had been taken by Washington;
but Washington, like Shirley, was but an amateur,
and a sounder military judgment would have shown that
the suggestions of both were faulty. Disembarkation
at Philadelphia, and a march directly westward from
thence, would have saved not only distance and time
but much trouble and expense; for Pennsylvania, unlike
Maryland and Virginia, was a country rich in forage and
in the means of transport. It was the collection of
transport that was Braddock's first great difficulty.
The Pennsylvanians showed an apathy and unwillingness
which provoked even Washington to the remark
that they ought to be chastised. It was only by the
mediation of Benjamin Franklin, of all persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that Braddock at last obtained waggons and horses
sufficient for his needs. The General's trials were
doubtless great, but his domineering temper, and the
insolent superiority which he affected as an Englishman
over Americans and as a regular officer over colonial
militiamen, could not tend to ease the general friction
between British and Provincials. His example was
doubtless followed by his officers, the more so since it
had been ordained that the King's commission should
confer superiority in all grades, and that Provincial
field-officers and generals were to enjoy no rank with
Imperial officers of the same standing. Nevertheless
Braddock was too capable a man to blind himself to the
merit of the ablest of his coadjutors; and it was in
terms honourable to himself that he invited and obtained
the services of Colonel George Washington upon his staff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.</div>

<p>On the 10th of May Braddock reached his base at
the junction of Wills' Creek with the Potomac, where
the former trading station had been supplanted by a
fort built of logs and called, in honour of the
Commander-in-Chief, by the name of Fort Cumberland.
It was a mere clearing in a vast forest, an oasis, as it has
happily been termed, in a wilderness of leaves.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Here
the troops had already been assembled, the Forty-fourth
and Forty-eighth, each now raised by recruits
from Virginia to a strength of seven hundred men, a
detachment of one hundred of the Royal Artillery,
thirty sailors lent by Commodore Keppel, helpful men
as are all of their kind, and four hundred and fifty
Virginian militia, excellently fitted for the work before
them but much despised by the regular troops. The
whole force amounted to about twenty-two hundred
men. Fifty Indian warriors, a source of unfailing
interest to the bucolic British soldiers, were also seen in
the camp in all their barbaric finery of paint and feathers;
for Braddock, whatever his bigotry in favour of pipe-clay,
was far too wise to underrate the value of Indian
scouts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 3.<br />June 7.</div>

<p>A long month of delay followed, for the cannon did
not arrive until a week later than Braddock, and the
arrangements were still backward and confused. The
General, doubtless with good reason, railed furiously
at the roguery and ill-faith of the contractors; but it
is sufficiently evident that what was lacking at headquarters
was a talent for organisation. And meanwhile,
though Braddock knew it not, events of incalculable
moment were going forward elsewhere during
those very weeks. The French had not failed to take
note of the reinforcements sent by England to America,
and had replied by equipping a fleet of eighteen ships
and embarking three thousand troops to sail under their
convoy to Canada. The departure of this fleet was
long delayed, and the dilatory British Government had
time to despatch two squadrons to intercept it; but
the French, putting to sea at last in May, contrived to
elude the British cruisers and arrived safely at Louisburg
and Quebec. Three only of their ships, having lagged
behind the rest, found themselves off Cape Race in the
presence of Admiral Boscawen's squadron. The two
nations were nominally at peace, but the fleets opened
fire, and the engagement ended in the capture of two of
the French ships. Whether Newcastle desired it or not,
England by this act was irrevocably committed to war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 10.<br />June 16.</div>

<p>It was just three days after this action that Braddock's
force moved out of Fort Cumberland for its
tedious march through the forest. Three hundred
axemen led the way to cut and clear the road, which
being but twelve feet wide was filled with waggons,
pack-horses and artillery, so that the troops were obliged
to march in the forest on either hand. Scouts scoured
the ground in advance and flanking parties were thrown
out against surprise, for Braddock was no mere soldier
of the parade-ground. The march was insufferably
slow, the horses being weak from want of forage,
and the column dragged its length wearily along,
"moving always in dampness and shade,"<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the gloomy interminable forest. Who can reckon the
moral effect wrought on the ignorant and superstitious
minds of simple English lads by that dreary trail through
the heart of the wilderness? Day after day they toiled on
without sight of the sun, and night after night over the
camp-fire the Provincials filled them with hideous tales of
Indian ferocity and assured them, in heavy jest, that they
would be beaten.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The Forty-eighth had stood firm at
Falkirk; but the Forty-fourth had suffered heavily at
Prestonpans, and such preparation could be wholesome
for no regiment. Eight days' march saw the column advanced
but thirty miles on its way, many of the men sick
and most of the horses worn out, with no prospect ahead
but that of a worse road than ever. Then came a
report that five hundred French were on their way to
reinforce Fort Duquêsne; and by Washington's advice
Braddock decided to leave the heavy baggage, together
with a guard under Colonel Dunbar, to follow as best it
could, and himself to push on with a body of chosen
troops. Twelve hundred men were accordingly selected,
and with these and a convoy reduced to ten guns,
thirty waggons, and several pack-horses, the advance
was resumed. Still progress continued to be wonderfully
slow. The traditions of Flanders were strong in
Braddock, and by dint of halting, as Washington said,
to level every molehill and to throw a bridge over every
brook, he occupied four whole days in traversing the
next twelve miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>At length, on the 7th of July, the column reached
the mouth of Turtle Creek, a stream which enters the
Monongahela about eight miles from its junction with
the Alleghany, or in other words from Fort Duquêsne.
The direct way, though the shorter, lay through a
difficult country and a dangerous defile, so Braddock
resolved to ford the Monongahela, fetch a compass,
and ford it once more, in order to reach his destination.
The French meanwhile had received intelligence of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
advance on the 5th, and were not a little alarmed. The
force at the disposal of M. Contrecoeur, the commandant
of Fort Duquêsne, consisted only of a few companies
of regular troops, with a considerable body of Canadians
and nearly nine hundred Indians. He resolved, however,
to send off a detachment under Captain Beaujeu
to meet the British on the march, and told off to that
officer a force of about seventy regulars, twice as many
Canadians, and six hundred and fifty Indians, or about
nine hundred men in all. Early in the morning of the
8th this detachment marched away from Fort Duquêsne,
intending to wait in ambush for the British at some
favourable spot, and by preference at the second ford
of the Monongahela.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 8.</div>

<p>Braddock also had moved off early in the same
morning, but it was nearly one o'clock when he forded
the Monongahela for the second time. He himself
fully expected to be attacked at this point, and had sent
forward a strong advanced party under Lieutenant-Colonel
Gage, to clear the opposite bank. No enemy
however was encountered, for Beaujeu had been delayed
by some trouble with his Indians, and had been unable
to reach the ford in time. The main body of the
British therefore crossed the river with perfect regularity
and order, for Braddock wished to impress the minds
of any Frenchmen that might be watching him with
a sense of his superiority. The sky was cloudless,
and the men, full of confidence and spirit, took pride
in a movement nearer akin than any other during their
weary march to the displays of the parade-ground in
which they had been trained. On reaching the farther
bank the column made a short halt for rest, and then
resumed the march along a narrow track parallel to the
river and at the base of a steep ridge of hills. Around
it on all sides the forest frowned thick and impenetrable;
and Braddock took every possible precaution
against surprise. Several guides, with six Virginian
light horsemen, led the way; a musket-shot behind
them came an advanced party of Gage's vanguard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
followed by the vanguard itself, and then in succession
a party of axemen to clear the road, two guns with
their ammunition-waggons, and a rear-guard. Then
without any interval came the convoy, headed by a few
light horsemen, a working party, and three guns; the
waggons following as heretofore on the track, and the
troops making their way through the forest to right
and left, with abundance of parties pushed well out on
either flank.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the ford the track passed
over a wide and bushy ravine. Gage crossed this
ravine with his advanced guard, and the main body
was just descending to it when Gage's guides and
horsemen suddenly fell back, and a man dressed like
an Indian, but with an officer's gorget, was seen hurrying
along the path. At sight of the British, Beaujeu (for
the figure so strangely arrayed seems to have been no
other) turned suddenly and waved his hat. The signal
was followed by a wild war-whoop from his Indians
and by a sharp fire upon the advancing British from
the trees in their front. Gage's men at once deployed
with great steadiness and returned the fire in a succession
of deliberate volleys. They could not see a man of
the enemy, so that they shot of necessity at haphazard,
but the mere sound of the musketry was sufficient to
scare Beaujeu's Canadians, who fled away shamefully
to Fort Duquêsne. The third volley laid Beaujeu
dead on the ground, and Gage's two field-pieces coming
into action speedily drove the Indians away from the
British front.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the red-coats steadily advanced, the men
cheering lustily and shouting "God save the King";
and Captain Dumas, who had succeeded Beaujeu in the
command of the French, almost gave up the day for
lost. His handful of regular troops, however, stood
firm, and he and his brother officers by desperate
exertions succeeded in rallying the Indians. The
regulars and such few of the Canadians as stood by
them held their ground staunchly, and opened a fire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
platoons which checked the ardour of Gage's men;
while the Indians, yelling like demons but always
invisible, streamed away through the forest along both
flanks of the British, and there, from every coign of
vantage that skilful bushmen could find, poured a deadly
fire upon the hapless red-coats. The cheering was
silenced, for the men began to fall fast. For a time
they kept their ranks and swept the unheeding forest
with volley after volley, which touched no enemy
through the trees. They could see no foe, and yet the
bullets rained continually and pitilessly upon them
from front, flank, and rear, like a shower from a cloudless
sky. The trial at last was greater than they could
bear. They abandoned their guns, they broke their
ranks, and huddling themselves together like a herd of
fallow-deer they fell back in disorder, a mere helpless
mass of terrified men.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Braddock came up to the
front. On hearing the fire he had left four hundred
men under Colonel Sir Peter Halket of the Forty-fourth
to guard the baggage, and had advanced with
the remainder to Gage's assistance. As the fresh troops
came up, Gage's routed infantry plunged blindly in
among them, seeking shelter from the eternal hail of
bullets, and threw them likewise into confusion. In a
short time the whole of Braddock's force, excepting the
Virginians and Halket's baggage-guard, was broken up
into a succession of heaving groups, without order and
without cohesion, some facing this way, some facing
that way, conscious only of the hideous whooping of
the Indians, of bullets falling thickly among them from
they knew not whence, and that they could neither
charge nor return the fire. The Virginians alone, who
were accustomed to such work, kept their presence of
mind, and taking shelter behind the trees began to
answer the Indian fire in the Indian fashion. A few of
the British strove to imitate them as well as their inexperience
would permit; but Braddock would have none
of such things. Such fighting was not prescribed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the drill-book nor familiar in the battlefields of
Flanders,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and he would tolerate no such disregard of
order and discipline. Raging and cursing furiously he
drove British and Virginians alike back to their fellows
with his sword; and then noting that the fire was
hottest from a hill on the right flank of his advance, he
ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Burton to attack it with the
Forty-eighth. The panic had already spread far, and
it was only with infinite difficulty that Burton could
persuade a hundred men to follow him. He was
presently shot down, and at his fall the whole of his
men turned back. The scene now became appalling.
The gunners stood for a time to their guns and sent
round after round crashing uselessly into the forest;
but the infantry stood packed together in abject terror,
still loading and firing, now into the air, now into their
comrades, or fighting furiously with the officers who
strove to make them form. Braddock galloped to and
fro through the fire, mounting fresh horses as fast as
they were killed under him, and storming as though
at a field-day. Washington, by miracle unwounded
though his clothes were tattered with bullets, seconded
him with as noble an example of courage and devotion;
but it was too clear that the day was lost. Sixty out
of eighty-six officers had fallen, and Braddock, after the
slaughter had continued for three hours, ordered the
wreck of his force to retreat.</p>

<p>He was still struggling to bring the men off in some
kind of order when he fell from his horse, the fifth that
the Indians' fire had compelled him to mount on that
day, pierced by a bullet through arm and lungs. The
unwounded remnant of his troops instantly broke loose
and fled away. In vain Washington and others strove
to rally them at the ford; they might as well have tried
to stop the wild bears of the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> They splashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>through the river exhausted though they were, and ran
on with the whoops of the Indians still ringing in their
ears. Gage succeeded in rallying about eighty at the
second ford; but the rest were not to be stayed. Braddock,
stricken to the death, begged to be left on the
battlefield, but some officers lifted him and carried him
away, for not a man of the soldiers would put a hand to
him. Weak as he was, and racked with the pain of his
wound and the anguish of his defeat, the gallant man
still kept command and still gave his orders. On passing
the Monongahela he bade his bearers halt, and
sending Washington away to Dunbar for provisions
and transport he passed the night among the handful of
men that had been rallied by Gage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 9.<br />July 10.</div>

<p>On the next morning some order was restored, and
the retreat was continued. Meanwhile stragglers had
already reached Dunbar's camp with wild tidings of
disaster and defeat, and many of the teamsters had
already taken to their heels. After one more day of
torture Braddock himself was carried into the camp.
On the march he had issued directions for the collection
and relief of stragglers, and now he gave, or is said to
have given, his last order, for the destruction of all
waggons and stores that could not be carried back to
Fort Cumberland. Accordingly scores of waggons were
burned, the provisions were destroyed, and guns and
ammunition, not easily to be replaced in the colonies,
were blown up or spoiled. Then the relics of the army
set out in shame and confusion for the return march of
sixty miles to Fort Cumberland. Braddock travelled
but a little distance with it. His faithful aide-de-camp,
Captain Orme, though himself badly wounded, remained
with him to the end and has recorded his last words;
but there was little speech now left in the rough, bullying
martinet, whose mouth had once been so full of
oaths, and whose voice had been the terror of every
soldier. It was not only that his lungs were shot
through and through, but that his heart was broken.
Throughout the first day's march he lay white and silent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
with his life's blood bubbling up through his lips,
nor was it till evening that his misery found vent in the
almost feminine ejaculation, "Who would have thought
it"? Again through the following day he remained
silent, until towards sunset, as if to sum up repentance
for past failure and good hope for the future, he murmured
gently, "Another time we shall know better how
to deal with them." And so having learned his lesson
he lay still, and a few minutes later he was dead.</p>

<p>With all his faults this rude indomitable spirit
appeals irresistibly to our sympathy. He had been
chosen by the Duke of Cumberland, whose notions of
an officer, in Horace Walpole's words, were drawn from
the purest German classics, the classics initiated by
Frederick William and consecrated by Frederick the
Great. It was the passion of the Hohenzollerns, great
soldiers though they were, to dress their men like dolls
and to manipulate them like puppets; but, dearly
though they loved the mechanical exercise of the parade-ground,
they knew that the minuteness of training and
the severity of discipline thereby entailed were but
means to an end. In the eyes of Cumberland, though
he was very far from a blind or a stupid man, powder,
pipe-clay, and precision loomed so large as to appear an
end in themselves. He could point too to the initial
success of his attack at Fontenoy, which was simply an
elaborate parade-movement; but he forgot that the
battlefields of a Prussian army and the adversaries of a
Prussian general were to be found on the familiar lands of
Silesia, Brandenburg, and Saxony, whereas the fighting-grounds
of the British were dispersed far and wide
among distant and untrodden countries, and their
enemies such as were not to be encountered according
to the precepts of Montecuculi and Turenne. It was
as a favourite exponent of Cumberland's military creed
that Braddock was sent to North America. He was
born and trained for such actions as Fontenoy; and it
was his fate to be confronted with a difficult problem in
savage warfare. His task was that which since his day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
has been repeatedly set to British officers, namely to
improvise a new system of fighting wherewith to meet
the peculiar tactics of a strange enemy in a strange
country. Too narrow, too rigid, and too proud to
apprehend the position, he applied the time-honoured
methods of Flanders, and he failed. Other officers have
since fallen into the like error, owing not a little to a
false system of training, and have failed likewise; and
vast as is our experience in savage warfare, it may
be that the tale of such officers is not yet fully
told. Nevertheless, though Braddock's ideal of a
British officer may have been mistaken, it cannot be
called low. In rout and ruin and disgrace, with the
hand of death gripping tightly at his throat, his stubborn
resolution never wavered and his untameable spirit was
never broken. He kept his head and did his work to
the last, and thought of his duty while thought was left
in him. His body was buried under the road, that the
passage of the troops over it might obliterate his grave
and save it from desecration from the Indians. But the
lesson which he had learned too late was not lost on his
successors, and it may truly be said that it was over the
bones of Braddock that the British advanced again to
the conquest of Canada.</p>

<p>The losses in this disastrous action were very heavy;
the devotion of the officers, whose conduct was beyond
all praise, leading them almost to annihilation. Among
the wounded were two men who were to become conspicuous
at a later day, Gage the leader of the advanced
guard and Captain Horatio Gates of the garrison of
New York. Of thirteen hundred and seventy-three
non-commissioned officers and men, but four hundred
and fifty-nine came off unharmed; and the wounded
that were left on the field were tortured and murdered
by the Indians after their barbarous manner. The loss
of the French was trifling. Three officers were killed
and four wounded, all of them at the critical moment
while their men were wavering; nine white men also
were killed and wounded, and a larger but inconsiderable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
number of Indians. It was in fact a total and crushing
defeat. Yet Count Dieskau, an officer high in the
French service in Canada, expressed no surprise when
he heard of it, for it was the French rule, founded on
bitter experience, never to expose regular troops in the
forest without a sufficient force of Indians and irregulars
to cover them. The Virginians, whose admirable behaviour
had been the one creditable feature in the
action, had shown that abundance of good irregular
troops were to be found in America; and it was
evident that the British needed only to learn from their
enemies in order to defeat them.</p>

    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1755.<br />June 16.</div>

<p class="noindent">The first blow against the French in America had
failed; it must now be seen how it fared with the
operations entrusted to Shirley, Johnson, and Monckton.
Shirley, at Massachusetts, had been busy since the beginning
of the year in calling the Northern provinces to
arms, and they had responded nobly, Massachusetts
alone raising forty-five hundred men, and the rest of
New England and New York nearly three thousand
more. The point first selected for attack was Fort
Beauséjour on the Acadian isthmus, for which object
two thousand volunteers of New England were sent up
to Monckton. Adding to them a handful of regular
troops from the garrison,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Monckton sailed away without
delay to his work. On the 1st of June the expedition
anchored in the bay before Fort Beauséjour, which
after a fortnight's siege and the feeblest of defences fell,
together with a smaller fort called Fort Gaspereau, into
Monckton's hands. This success was followed by the
expulsion of the greater part of the French population
from Acadia, a harsh measure necessitated entirely by
the duplicity of the Jesuit priests and of the Canadian
Government, who had never ceased to stir up the
unhappy peasants to revolt. From henceforth, therefore,
Acadia may be dismissed from the sphere of active
operations.</p>

<p>The attack on Crown Point was a more serious
matter, for which the force entrusted to William
Johnson included some three thousand Provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
troops from New England and New Hampshire, and
three hundred Indians. Johnson had seen no service
and was innocent of all knowledge of war, but his
influence with the Indians was very great, and as he
came from New York his appointment could not but be
pleasing to that province. His men were farmers and
farmers' sons, excellent material but neither drilled nor
trained. With the exception of one regiment, all wore
their own clothes, and far the greater number brought
with them their own arms. After long delay, owing to
the jealousies of the various provinces and to defective
organisation, the force was assembled at Albany, and in
August began to move up the Hudson towards Lake
George, a new name bestowed by Johnson in honour of
his sovereign. At the carrying-place, where the line of
advance left the Hudson, was built a fort, which was
first called Fort Lyman but subsequently Fort Edward,
by which latter name the reader should remember it.
Here five hundred men were left to complete and to
man the works, while the remainder, moving casually
and leisurely forward, advanced to the lake and encamped
upon its southern border.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French, warned by papers captured
from Braddock of the design against Crown Point,
had sent thither thirty-five hundred regular troops,
Canadians and Indians, under the command of Count
Dieskau, an officer who had served formerly under
Marshal Saxe. There were two lines by which Johnson
could advance against them, the one directly up Lake
George, the other by the stream named Wood Creek,
which runs parallel with it into Lake Champlain. The
junction of both passages is commanded by a promontory
on the western side of Lake Champlain, called by the
French Carillon, but more famous under its native
name of Ticonderoga. To this point Dieskau advanced
with a mixed force of fifteen hundred men, and from
thence pushed forward to attack Johnson in his camp.
The sequel may be briefly told. Johnson had imprudently
detached five hundred men with some vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
idea of cutting off Dieskau's retreat; and these were
caught in an ambuscade and very roughly handled.
But when, elated by this success, Dieskau advanced
against Johnson's camp he was met by a most stubborn
resistance; and finally his troops were driven back in
disorder and he himself wounded and taken prisoner.
Johnson, however, did not follow up this fortunate
success. Shirley repeatedly adjured him to advance
to Ticonderoga, but was answered that the troops were
unable to move through sickness, indiscipline, bad food,
and bad clothing. Johnson lingered on in his camp
until the end of November, with his men on the verge
of mutiny, and having built a fort at the southern end of
the lake, which he called Fort William Henry, retreated
to the Hudson. He was rewarded for his victory by a
vote of five thousand pounds from the British Parliament
and by a baronetcy from the King; but none the less
his enterprise was a failure, and Crown Point was left
safely in the hands of the French.</p>

<p>The expedition against Niagara was undertaken by
Shirley himself, in all the pride of a lawyer turned
general. Hitherto he had but planned campaigns on
paper; now he was to execute one in the field. His
base of operations was, like Johnson's, the town of
Albany, and his force consisted of his own regiment
and Pepperrell's, which, although the King's troops and
wearing the King's uniform, consisted none the less of
raw Provincial recruits, together with one regiment of
New Jersey militia, in all twenty-five hundred men.
From Albany the force ascended the river Mohawk in
bateaux to the great carrying-place, where the town of
Rome now stands; from which point the bateaux were
drawn overland on sledges to Wood Creek,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> where they
were again launched to float down stream to Lake
Oneida and so to the little fort of Oswego on Lake
Ontario. As might have been expected with an
amateur, Shirley's force arrived at its destination long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
before his supplies, so that his force was compelled to
wait for some time inactive and on short rations. The
French, too, having learned of this design also from
the papers taken at the Monongahela, had reinforced
their garrisons not only at Niagara but at Fort Frontenac
at the north-eastern outlet of the lake. This materially
increased Shirley's difficulties, for unless he first captured
Frontenac the French could slip across the lake directly
he was fairly on his way to Niagara, take Oswego and
cut him off from his base. To be brief, the task,
rendered doubly arduous by dearth of provisions, was
too great for Shirley's strength; and at the end of
October he abandoned the enterprise, having accomplished
no more than to throw a garrison of seven hundred
men into Oswego.</p>

<p>So amid general disappointment ended the American
campaign. Of the four expeditions one only had
succeeded; all of the rest had failed, one of them with
disaster. Nor did this disaster end with the retreat
from the Monongahela, for no sooner had Dunbar
retired from the frontier than the Indians, at the
instigation of the French, swarmed into Virginia,
Maryland, and Pennsylvania to the massacre and pillage
of the scattered settlements on the border. Washington
with fifteen hundred Virginian militia did what he could
to protect three hundred miles of frontier, but with
so small a force the duty was far beyond his power or
the power of any man. Reinforce him, however,
the Assembly of Pennsylvania would not. They closed
their ears even to the cry of their own settlers for
arms and ammunition, and for legislation to enable
them to organise themselves for defence. The Assembly
was intent only on fighting with the Governor. The
members would yield neither to his representations nor
to the entreaties of their fellow-citizens; and it was
not until the enemy had advanced within sixty miles of
Philadelphia that, grudgingly and late, they armed the
Governor with powers to check the Indian invasion.
It was none too soon, for the French had taken note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of the large population of pauperised Germans, Irish,
"white servants," and transported criminals in Pennsylvania,
and were preparing to turn it into a recruiting-ground
for the French service.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Thus closed the year 1755, with hostilities in full
play between English and French in North America.
Yet war had not been declared, nor, though it was
certain to come, had any preparation been made for it.
The measures taken at the beginning of 1755 sufficiently
indicate the feebleness and vacillation of a foolish and
effete Administration. In February some addition had
been made to the infantry by raising the strength of the
Guards and of seven regiments of the Line; and in
March the King sent a message to Parliament requesting
an augmentation of the forces by land and sea. The
Ministry employed the powers thus given to them in
raising five thousand marines in fifty independent
companies, and placing them expressly under the
command of the Lord High Admiral. It is said<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> that
Newcastle refused to raise new regiments from jealousy
of the Duke of Cumberland's nomination of officers,
and there is nothing incredible in the assertion. But
though this measure pointed at least to activity on the
part of the fleet, never were British ships employed to
less purpose. The squadron sent out under Boscawen
to intercept the French reinforcements on their way to
Louisburg was considerably inferior to the enemy's
fleet, and required to be reinforced, of course at the cost
of confusion and delay, before it was fit to fulfil its
duty. Fresh trouble was caused in May by the King's
departure for Hanover, a pleasure which he refused to
deny himself despite the critical state of affairs in
England. During his absence his power was delegated,
as was customary, to a Council of Regency, a body
which was always disposed to reserve matters of importance
for the King's decision, and was doubly infirm
of purpose with such a creature as Newcastle among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>its ruling spirits. A powerful fleet under Sir Edward
Hawke was ready for sea and for action; and the Duke
of Cumberland, remembering the consequences of
peaceful hostility in 1742 and 1743, was for throwing
off the mask, declaring open war and striking swiftly
and at once. He was, however, overruled, and Hawke's
fleet was sent to sea with instructions that bound it to
a violation of peace and a travesty of war. The King
meanwhile was solicitous above all things for the security
of Hanover. Subsidiary treaties with Bavaria and
Saxony for the protection of the Electorate had for
some time existed, but were expired or expiring; and
now that some return for the subsidies of bygone years
seemed likely to be required, the contracting States
stood out for better terms. The King therefore
entered into a new treaty with Hesse-Cassel for the
supply of eight thousand men, and with Russia for
forty thousand more, in the event of the invasion of
Hanover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 15.</div>

<p>With these treaties in his pocket he returned to
England, to find the nation full of alarm and discontent.
Nor was the nation at fault in its feelings. In August
the news of Braddock's defeat had arrived and had been
received with impotent dismay. Yet nothing was done
to retrieve the disaster, and two full months passed before
a few thousand men were added to all three arms of the
Army.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Meanwhile Newcastle, after vainly endeavouring
to persuade Pitt to serve under him, had strengthened
his ministry somewhat by securing the accession of
Henry Fox; and on the 13th of November the King
opened Parliament, announcing, as well he might, the
speedy approach of war. A long debate followed,
wherein Pitt surpassed himself in denunciation of
subsidiary treaties and contemptuous condemnation of
Newcastle; but the party of the Court was too strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
for him, and the treaties were confirmed by a large
majority. Pitt was dismissed from his office of Paymaster,
and Fox having been promoted to be Secretary
of State was succeeded by Lord Barrington as Secretary
at War. Lastly, some weeks later, General Ligonier
was most unjustly ousted from the post of Master-General
of the Ordnance, to make way for a place-hunter
who was not ashamed thus to disgrace his
honoured title of Duke of Marlborough. It seemed,
in fact, as though there were a general conspiracy to
banish ability from high station.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 27.<br />Dec. 5.<br />Dec. 8.</div>

<p>A fortnight later the estimates for the Army were
submitted to Parliament. Notwithstanding the urgent
danger of the situation, the number of men proposed
on the British Establishment little exceeded thirty-four
thousand men for Great Britain and thirteen thousand
for the colonies. A few days afterwards the question
was debated, and Barrington then announced a further
increase of troops; whereupon Pitt very pertinently
asked the unanswerable question why all these augmentations
were made so late. The House, however, was
in earnest as to the military deficiencies of the country.
Fox had taunted Pitt by challenging him to bring
forward a Militia Bill, and Pitt seized the opportunity
offered by a debate on the Militia to give the outlines
of a scheme for making that force more efficient. His
proposals were embodied in a Bill, which formed the
basis of the Militia Act that was to be passed, as shall
be seen, in the following year. So far therefore the
Commons forced upon the Government and the country
at least the consideration of really valuable work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756.</div>

<p>On the re-assembly of Parliament after Christmas
an estimate was presented for the formation of ten new
regiments, to be made up in part of certain supplementary
companies which had been added to existing
battalions in 1755. These new regiments were, in
order of seniority, Abercromby's, Napier's, Lambton's,
Whitmore's, Campbell's, Perry's, Lord Charles Manner's,
Arabin's, Anstruther's and Montagu's, and they are still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
with us numbered in succession the Fiftieth to the Fifty-ninth.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
At the same time a new departure was made
by adding a light troop apiece to eleven regiments of
dragoons, both men and horses being specially equipped
for the work which is now expected of all cavalry, but
which was then entrusted chiefly to irregular horse formed
upon the model of the Austrian Hussars. Yet another
novelty was foreshadowed in February when a Bill was
introduced to enable the King to grant commissions to
foreign Protestants in America. The origin of this
measure, according to Horace Walpole, was a proposal
made by one Prevost, a Protestant refugee, to raise
four battalions of Swiss and Provincials in America,
with a British officer for colonel-in-chief but with a fair
number of foreigners holding other commissions. Quite
as probably this new step was quickened, if not suggested,
by the news that the French contemplated the enlistment
of recruits among the foreign population of British
America. The vote for these four battalions was
passed without a division, though Pitt opposed the
Bill with all his power and was supported by a petition
from the Agent of Massachusetts. He was vehement
for the employment of British soldiers to fight British
battles; whereas so far the most important military
measure of King and ministers had been the hiring of
Germans. The Bill was none the less passed, and on the
4th of March the order for the enlistment of the four
battalions was given. Lord Loudoun was to be their
Colonel-in-Chief, Pennsylvania their recruiting-ground,
and their title the Royal Americans, an appellation long
since displaced by the famous number of the Sixtieth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March 23.</div>

<p>Amid all these preparations, however, the nation
throughout the first months of 1756 lived in abject
terror of an invasion. France on her side had not been
backward in equipping herself for the approaching
contest. Great activity at Toulon had been followed by
equal activity at Dunkirk, and despite good information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
as to the true object of the armaments fitted out at
these two ports, the people naturally, and the Government
most culpably, persisted in the belief that they
were designed for a descent upon Britain herself. Few
troops were ready to meet such a descent, for votes
cannot improvise trained officers and men, and the folly
of the Administration had done its worst to discourage
enlistment. When the danger seemed nearest, many
great landowners had interested themselves personally
and with great success to obtain recruits; and among
others Lord Ilchester and Lord Digby in Somerset had
attracted some of the best material to be found in rural
England, promising that the men so enlisted should not
be required to serve outside the Kingdom. Notwithstanding
this pledge, however, these recruits were by
order of the Ministry forcibly driven on board transports
and shipped off to Gibraltar. Never was there more
brutal and heartless instance of the ill-faith kept by a
British Government towards the British soldier. Having
thus checked the flow of recruits at home, the Ministry
turned to Holland and asked for the troops which she
was bound by treaty to furnish. The request was
refused; whereupon a royal message was actually sent
to Parliament announcing that the King in the present
peril had sent for his contingent of Hessian troops from
Germany, for the defence of England. The message
was received with murmurs in the Commons, as well it
might be, but it was not opposed; and indeed the
climax of disgrace was not yet reached. Whether from
desire to embarrass Newcastle or to pay court to the
King, Lord George Sackville, an officer whom before
long we shall know too well, expressed a preference for
Hanoverians over Hessians, and proposed an address
praying the King to bring over his own electoral troops.
Pitt left his sickbed and came down, ill as he was, to
the House, to appeal to the history of the past and to
the pride of every Englishman against the motion; yet
it was passed by a majority of nearly three to one.
The Lords consented to join the Commons in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
address, the King granted their prayer, and the result
was that both Hanoverians and Hessians were imported
to defend this poor Island that could not defend herself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 16.</div>

<p>The next business brought before Parliament furnished
new evidence of the general confusion of affairs.
As might have been foreseen, Frederick of Prussia
had viewed with no friendly eye the treaty made by
King George with Russia; and he now proposed,
as an alternative, that Hanover and England should
combine with Prussia to keep all troops whatsoever
from entering the German Empire. Since Frederick
had already announced his intention of attacking the
Russians if they moved across the frontier, and since
there was good reason to apprehend that, if driven to
desperation, he might join with the French in overrunning
Hanover, the Russian treaty was thrown over,
and the new arrangement accepted by King George.
The pecuniary conditions attached to the agreement
were duly ratified by the House of Commons in May,
with results that were to reach further than were yet
dreamed of. Then at last, apparently as an after-thought,
war was formally declared. The country being thus
definitely committed to a struggle which might be for
life or death, the Lords supported by Newcastle seized
the opportunity to reject the Militia Bill, which was
the one important military measure so far brought
forward. The general helplessness of the moment,
owing to the absence of a strong hand at the helm, is
almost incredible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 8.<br />April 18.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the French had struck their first blow,
not on the shores of Britain, but at Minorca. As early
as in January the Ministry had received good intelligence
of the true destination of the enemy's armaments, but
had made no sufficient preparation to meet the danger;
nor was it until the 7th of April that it sent a fleet of
ten ships, ill-manned and ill-found, under Admiral
Byng to the Mediterranean. On the day following
Byng's departure twelve ships of the line under M.
de la Galissonière, with transports containing sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
thousand troops under the Duke of Richelieu, weighed
from Toulon, and on the 18th dropped anchor off the
port of Ciudadella, at the north-western end of Minorca.
General Blakeney, the governor, had received warning
of the intended attack two days before, and had made
such preparations as he could for defence; but the
means at his disposal were but poor. He had four
regiments, the Fourth, Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth,
and Thirty-fourth of the Line; to which Commodore
Edgcumbe, who was lying off Mahon with a squadron
too weak to encounter the French, had added all the
marines that he could spare before sailing away to
Gibraltar. Even so, however, Blakeney could muster
little more than twenty-eight hundred men. But his
most serious difficulty was lack of officers. He himself
had won his ensigncy under Cutts the Salamander at
Venloo, and he had maintained his reputation for firmness
and courage at Stirling in 1745, but he was now past
eighty, crippled with gout and unfit to bear the incessant
labours of a siege. Nevertheless he was obliged to
take the burden upon him from sheer dearth of senior
officers. The lieutenant-governor of the Island, the
governor of its principal defence, Fort Philip, and the
colonels of all four regiments were absent; nineteen
subalterns had never yet joined their respective corps,
and nine more officers were absent on recruiting duties.
In all five-and-thirty officers were wanting at their
posts. It was the old evil against which George the
First had struggled in vain, and it was now about to
bear bitter fruit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.<br />May.</div>

<p>Richelieu landed on the 18th, and Blakeney at once
withdrew the whole of his force to Fort St. Philip in
order to make his stand there. This fortress, which
commanded the town and harbour of Mahon, was
probably the most elaborate possessed by the British,
and was inferior in strength to few strongholds in
Europe. Apart from the ordinary elaborations of the
school of Vauban, it was strengthened by countless
mines and galleries hewn out of the solid rock, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
afforded unusual protection to the defenders. Blakeney
had little time to break up the roads or otherwise to
hinder the French advance; and Richelieu, marching
into the town of Mahon on the 19th, was able a few
days later to begin the siege. His operations, however,
were unskilfully conducted, and the garrison defended
itself with great spirit. An officer of engineers, Major
Cunningham by name, while on his way to England
from Minorca on leave, had heard of the French designs
upon the Island and had instantly hurried back to his
old post to assist in the defence; and his skill and
resource were of inestimable value. So clumsily in
fact did the French manage their operations that it was
not until the 8th of May that their batteries began to
produce the slightest effect.</p>

<p>Byng meanwhile had arrived at Gibraltar and had
learned what was going forward. He carried the
Seventh Fusiliers on board his fleet for Minorca, and
had orders to embark yet another battalion from
Gibraltar as a further reinforcement. General Fowke,
however, who was in command at the Rock, urged that
his instructions on this latter point were discretionary
only and that he could not spare a battalion, having
barely sufficient men to furnish reliefs for the ordinary
guards. He therefore declined to grant more than two
hundred and fifty men, to replace the marines landed
from the fleet by Commodore Edgcumbe. It is
instructive to note the difficulties imposed upon
the commanders by the neglect of the Government.
Hitherto one of the first measures taken in prospect of
a war had been the reinforcement of the Mediterranean
garrisons. Now, after a full year of warning, they
were left unstrengthened and unsupported. Nay,
Richelieu had lain in front of Fort St. Philip for three
whole weeks before three battalions were at last ordered
to sail for Gibraltar.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Byng's fleet was so slenderly
manned that he required the Seventh Fusiliers for duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
on board ship, and therefore asked Fowke for a battalion
for Minorca; Fowke's position was so weak that he
dared not comply; and Blakeney's force was so inadequate
that, though he could indeed hold his own in
the fortress, he dared not venture his troops in a sortie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 6.<br />June 9.<br />June 14.<br />June 27.<br />June 28.</div>

<p>At length on the 19th of May Byng came in sight
of Fort St. Philip, and on the following day fought
the indecisive action and made the unfortunate retreat
which became memorable through his subsequent fate.
The besieged, though greatly disappointed by his
withdrawal, still defended themselves stoutly and with
fine spirit. The fortress was well stored and the
batteries were well and effectively served. Six more
battalions were now sent to Richelieu, and the French
plan of attack was altered. New batteries were built,
which on the 6th of June opened fire from over one
hundred guns and mortars, inflicting much damage and
making a considerable breach. The British repaired
the injured works and stood to their guns as steadily
as ever; but on the 9th the French fire reopened more
hotly than before and battered two new breaches.
Matters were now growing serious; and on the 14th
a party of the garrison made a sally, drove the French
from several of their batteries and spiked the guns, but
pursuing their success too far were surrounded and
captured almost to a man. Still Richelieu hesitated to
storm; nor was it until the night of the 27th that he
nerved himself for a final effort and made a grand
attack upon several quarters of the fortress simultaneously.
The defence was of the stubbornest, and the
successful explosion of a mine sent three companies of
French grenadiers flying into the air; but three of the
principal outworks were carried, and the ablest officer
of the garrison, Lieutenant-Colonel Jefferies, while
hurrying down to save one of them, was cut off and
made prisoner with a hundred of his men. Cunningham
also was severely wounded and rendered unfit for duty.
With hardly men enough left to him to man the guns,
Blakeney on the 28th capitulated with the honours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
war, and the garrison was embarked for Gibraltar.
The siege had lasted for seventy days and had cost the
French at the least two thousand men. The losses of
the garrison were relatively small, amounting to less
than four hundred killed and wounded, and the surrender
was no dishonour to the British Army; but there was
no disguising the disgraceful fact that Minorca was
gone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>On the 14th of July the news reached England,
and the nation, frantic with rage and shame, looked
about savagely for a scapegoat. Bitter and cruel attacks
were made even upon poor old Blakeney, who for all
his fourscore years had never changed his clothes nor
gone to bed during the ten weeks of the siege. Fowke
was tried by court-martial for disobedience of orders
in refusing to send the battalion required of him from
Gibraltar, and though acquitted of all but an error in
judgment and sentenced to a year's suspension only,
was dismissed the service by the King. Finally, as is
well known, the public indignation fastened itself upon
Byng; and the unfortunate Admiral was shot because
Newcastle deserved to be hanged. Old Blakeney alone,
as was his desert, became a hero and was rewarded with
an Irish peerage. Amid all the disgrace of that miserable
time men found leisure to chronicle with a sneer
that the veteran went to Court in a hackney coach with
a foot-soldier behind it. St. James's would not have
been the worse for a few more courtiers and lacqueys
of the same rugged stamp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 23.</div>

<p>More disasters were at hand; but the general
paralysis in England continued. Such troops as the
country possessed were still distributed as though an
invasion were imminent. There was a camp at Cheltenham
under Lord George Sackville, and another in
Dorsetshire; the Hessians were at Winchester, the
Hanoverians about Maidstone, the artillery massed
together under the Duke of Marlborough at Byfleet;
all doing nothing when there was so much to be done.
The news of Braddock's defeat was nearly eight months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
old when Byng sailed for the Mediterranean, but not
a man had been embarked to America. Up to the end
of March the only step taken had been the despatch of
Colonel Webb to supersede Shirley as Commander-in-Chief,
but with instructions to yield the command to
General Abercromby, who was also under orders for
America, on his arrival; while Abercromby in turn
was to give place to Lord Loudoun. At last, towards
the end of April the Thirty-fifth Foot and the Forty-second
Highlanders were embarked and reached New
York late in June; and a month later Lord Loudoun
arrived and assumed the command. Pitt before its
departure had described the force under Loudoun's
orders as a scroll of paper, and the description was little
remote from the truth. Of the Sixtieth hardly one
battalion was yet raised; Shirley's and Pepperrell's
regiments, or what was left of them, were in garrison
at Oswego; and the levies of the various colonies as
usual were long in enlisting, late in arriving, and not
too well supplied. Finally, each several contingent was
jealously kept by its province under its own orders and
control.</p>

<p>Shirley, undismayed by the failures of the previous
year, meditated further operations in the direction of
Fort Frontenac and Niagara, and against Crown Point;
and with this view he had accumulated supplies along
the route to Oswego on the one hand, and at Forts
Edward and William Henry on the other. The troops
which he had appointed for Niagara were the shattered
remains of the Forty-fourth and Forty-eighth, part of
his own and of Pepperrell's regiments, four independent
regular companies from New York, and a small body
of Provincials. The enterprise against Crown Point
was assigned to the Provincial forces of New England
and New York. Loudoun's instructions seem to have
prescribed for him much the same line as Shirley had
marked out for himself; but the new Commander-in-Chief
conceived an immense and not wholly unreasonable
contempt for Shirley and for all his works. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
first place, he found that his predecessor had emptied
the military chest, and that there was remarkably little
to show for the outlay. Oswego, on inspection by a
competent engineer, was declared incapable of defence,
being ill-designed and incomplete, while the garrison
through sickness and neglect was in a shocking condition.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
The fact was that the King's boats had been used to
transport merchandise for sale by private speculators to
the Indians, instead of food for the nourishment of the
King's troops. Fort William Henry again was found
to be in an indescribably filthy state. Graves, slaughter-houses,
and latrines were scattered promiscuously about
the camp; no discipline was maintained; provisions
were scandalously wasted; and the men were dying at
the rate of thirty a week. Loudoun decided almost
immediately to abandon the attack on Niagara and to
turn all his strength against Ticonderoga and Crown
Point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August 12.<br />August 9.<br />August 14.</div>

<p>Meanwhile there were sinister rumours that the
French were likely to attack Oswego, and Loudoun
sent Colonel Webb with the Forty-fourth regiment to
reinforce the garrison. Webb had hardly reached the
Great Carrying-place on his way, when the news met
him that Oswego had already been captured. On the
night of the 9th the Marquis of Montcalm, an energetic
officer who had arrived in Canada in May 1755, had
swooped down swiftly and secretly upon the fort with
three thousand men, and after three days' cannonade
had forced it to surrender. Webb at once retired with
precipitation, and in alarm at a report that the French
were advancing upon New York, burned the fort at
the Great Carrying-place and retreated down the
Mohawk. Such timidity was worthy of Newcastle's
nominee; and this disaster brought the whole of the
operations to a standstill. Montcalm having burned
Oswego retired to Ticonderoga, where with five thousand
men he took up a position from which Loudoun could
not hope, with the troops at his disposal, to dislodge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
him. The British General therefore contented himself
with improving the defences of Fort Edward; and
therewith ended the campaign of 1756 in North America.
Everything had gone as ill as possible. Loudoun had
shown great impatience with the Provincials, and the
Provincials had taken no pains to help him. In Pennsylvania
every conceivable obstacle was thrown in the
way of recruiting; in New York there was not less
friction over the quartering of the King's troops. There
were reasons sufficient in the jealousy, the inexperience,
and occasionally the corruption of the Provincials to
excuse impatience in the General, but Loudoun was not
conciliatory in manner nor had he the ability which
commands confidence. He was, in fact, one more of
the incompetent men nominated by an incompetent
Administration. All that he could show for his first
campaign was the loss of Oswego, the station which
bound the British colonies to the great Indian trade
with the West, the place of arms from which the chain
of French posts was to be cut in two, in a word the
sharpest and deadliest weapon in the armoury of British
North America. Small wonder that the French were
filled with triumph and the British colonies with
dismay.</p>

<p>The news of yet another reverse heaped fuel on the
flame of the nation's indignation against Newcastle;
but meanwhile the cloud of war which had hung so
long in menace over Europe burst at last in one tremendous
storm. For some months past a league had
been forming between France, Austria, Saxony, Russia,
and Sweden to crush Frederick the Great and partition
Prussia. France had been launched into this strange
alliance by Madame de Pompadour, in revenge for
Frederick's disdainful rejection of a friendly message;
the Czarina likewise sought vengeance for an epigram;
Austria burned to recover Silesia; Saxony had been
enticed by Austria with the lure of a share in partitioned
Prussia; and Sweden had been attracted by the bait of
Pomerania. Frederick, fully aware of all that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
going forward, resolved to meet the danger rather than
await it, and boldly invading Saxony began the Seven
Years' War. Where it should end no man could divine.
All that was certain was that Frederick, far from protecting
Hanover, would have much ado to defend
himself. Thus, then, on the one side there was Hanover
open to attack, and on the other Minorca lost, British
naval reputation tarnished, and France triumphant in
America. Further, though as yet men knew it not, the
news of the loss of Calcutta and of the tragedy of the
Black Hole was even then on its way across the ocean.
The outcry against the Government rose to a dangerous
height; Fox deserted Newcastle, and resigned; and at
length, in November, the shifty old jobber himself, after
endless intrigues to retain office, reluctantly and ungracefully
made way, nominally for the Duke of Devonshire,
but in reality for William Pitt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 2.<br />1757.<br />January.</div>

<p>On the 2nd of December Parliament met, and the
spirit of the new minister showed itself at once in the
speech from the throne. The electoral troops and
Hessians were to be sent back forthwith to Germany;
and it was now the royal desire, which it had not been
before Pitt took office, that the militia should be made
more efficient. In a word, England was from henceforth
to fight her battles for herself. Two days later
leave was granted for the introduction of a Militia Bill,
and on the 15th estimates were submitted for a British
Establishment of thirty thousand men for the service
of Great Britain and nineteen thousand for the colonies,
besides two thousand artillery and engineers; the
absence of Minorca from its usual place in the list of
garrisons providing a significant comment on the whole.
Of the additional troops fifteen thousand had already
been appointed for enlistment in September, when orders
had been issued for the raising of a second battalion to
each of fifteen regiments of the Line.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> These battalions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
were erected two years later into distinct regiments, of
which ten still remain with us, numbered the Sixty-first
to the Seventieth. This addition showed marks of
Pitt's influence, but after the Christmas recess his handiwork
was seen in a new and daring experiment, namely
the formation of two regiments of Highlanders, each
eleven hundred strong, which, though afterwards disbanded,
became famous under the names of their
Colonels, Fraser and Montgomery.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The idea was a
bold one, for it struck the last weapon from the dying
hands of Jacobitism and turned it against itself; and
the result soon approved it as a success. The existing
Scottish regiments were required to contribute eighty
non-commissioned officers who could speak Gaelic;<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
and the Highlander from henceforth took his place not
as a subverter of thrones but as a builder of empires.
It is remarkable, concurrently, to note the sudden wave
of energy which swept over the entire military administration
in the first weeks of 1757, when the breath of
one great man had once broken the springs and set the
stagnant waters aflow. Shirley's and Pepperrell's regiments,
which had been crippled and ruined at Oswego,
were struck off the list of the Army to make room for
more efficient corps.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Newcastle's feeble ministers had
directed the embarkation of a single battalion only,
besides drafts, to America: Pitt, without counter-ordering
these, ordered the augmentation and despatch of seven
battalions more.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The Forty-ninth regiment, which
was serving in Jamaica, was increased to nearly double
of its former strength, to hearten the colonists in that
Island. The Royal Artillery was raised to a total of
twenty-four companies and distributed into two battalions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>and a company of Miners, first conceived of six
months before, was incorporated with it.<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Finally, the
Marines, which had been creeping up in strength ever
since the beginning of the war, were augmented from
one hundred to one hundred and thirty companies, so
that men should not be lacking for the fleet. Nor was
it only in the mere activity of departments and ubiquity
of recruiting sergeants that the spirit of the master was
seen. The nation was stirred by such military ardour
as it had not felt since the Civil War, and there was a
rush for commissions in the Army.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>On the re-assembling of Parliament the Militia Bill
was again brought forward, and, though it did not pass
the Lords until June, was so essential a feature of Pitt's
first short Administration that it may be dealt with here
once and for all. The measure was introduced by
George Townsend and was practically identical with
that which had been rejected in the previous year,
though Henry Conway, an officer of some distinction, had
prepared an alternative scheme which was preferred by
many. The Bill as ultimately passed appointed a proportion
of men to be furnished for the Militia in every
county of England and Wales, from Devonshire and
Middlesex, which were to provide sixteen hundred men
apiece, to Anglesey, which was called upon for no more
than eighty. These men were to be chosen by lot from
lists drawn up by the parochial authorities for the Lords-Lieutenants
and their deputies; and every man so
chosen was to serve for three years, at the close of which
period he was to enjoy exemption until his time should
come again. Thus it was designed that every eligible
man in succession should pass through the ranks and
serve for a fixed term. Special powers were given to
justices and to deputy-lieutenants to discharge men from
duty on sufficient reason shown, or after two years of
service if they were over five-and-thirty years of age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>The possession of a certain property was required as a
qualification for officers, who likewise were entitled to
discharge after four years' service, provided that others
could be found to take their places. Provision was also
made for the appointment by the King of an adjutant
from the regular Army to every regiment, and of a
sergeant to every twenty men. The organisation was by
regiments of from seven to twelve companies, in which
no company was to be of smaller strength than eighty
men. The Lord-Lieutenant of each county was in
command of that county's militia; and in case of urgent
danger the King was empowered to embody the whole
force, communicating his reasons to Parliament if in
session, when officers and men became entitled to the
pay of their rank in the Army and subject to the articles
of war. It had been part of the original design, favoured
with reservations by Pitt himself, that Sunday should
be a day of exercise, as in Switzerland and other Protestant
countries; but this clause was dropped in deference
to petitions from several dissenting sects, and it was
finally enacted that the men should be drilled in half-companies
and whole companies alternately on every
Monday from April to October. The Act was not
passed without much opposition in the Lords, who
indeed reduced the numbers of the force to thirty-two
thousand men, or one-half of the strength voted by the
Commons, and added clauses which clogged the working
of the measure. Nor was it at first enforced without
dangerous riot and tumult in some quarters, due principally
to the unscrupulous employment, already narrated,
of men enlisted for duty at home on foreign service.
Nevertheless the great step was taken. A local force
had been established for domestic defence, and the
regular Army was set free for service abroad, or more
truly for the service of conquest.</p>

<p>During the early debates on the Militia Bill Pitt
himself was absent, being confined to his house by
gout; nor was it until the 17th of February that he
appeared in his place to support the royal request for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
subsidies for Hanover and for the King of Prussia.
The occasion drew upon him not a few sarcasms, for no
man had more vehemently denounced the turning of
Great Britain into a milch cow for the Electorate; but
he waived the sneers aside in his wonted imperious
fashion, for, consistent or inconsistent, he knew at least
his own mind. It was one thing for British interests
to be subordinated to Hanoverian; but it was quite
another for Britain and Hanover to march shoulder to
shoulder against a common enemy for their common
advantage. The conquest of America in Germany
was, as shall be seen, no idle phrase, though few as yet
might comprehend its purport. But suddenly at this
point Pitt's career was for the moment checked. Notwithstanding
this proof of his loyalty to the cause of
Hanover, the King was still unfriendly towards his
new minister, and actually found, in the peril which
threatened his beloved Electorate, a pretext for dismissing
him from office. In March 1757 a French army of
one hundred thousand men poured over the Rhine; and
it was necessary to call out the Hanoverian troops to
oppose it. The King was urgent for the Duke of
Cumberland to command these forces, but the Duke
was by no means so anxious to accept the trust. The
memory of past failure oppressed him; and, since he
hated Pitt, he was unwilling to correspond with him or
to depend on him for instructions and supplies. To
obviate this difficulty the King agreed to remove Pitt;
and thus a minister of genius was discarded that an
unskilful commander might take the field. It was a
proceeding worthier of Versailles than of St. James's.</p>

<p>On the 5th of April Pitt, having refused to resign,
received intimation of his dismissal; but by this time
the nation had been roused to such a pitch that it
would suffer no return to the imbecile and disgraceful
administration of the past two years. The stocks fell;
all the principal towns in England sent the freedom of
their corporations to Pitt, and, in Walpole's phrase, for
weeks it rained gold boxes. The King turned to Newcastle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
but the contemptible old intriguer tried in vain
to form a government with Pitt or without him. For
eleven whole weeks the negotiations continued and the
country was left virtually without a government of any
kind, until at length it was seen that Pitt's return to
office was inevitable, and on the 27th of July, though
Newcastle still retained the post of First Lord of the
Treasury, Pitt was finally reinstated as Secretary of
State on his own terms, that is to say, with full control
of the war and of foreign affairs. "I will borrow the
Duke's majority to carry on the Government," he had
said, "I am sure that I can save this country and that
no one else can."</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 9.</div>

<p>This was the turning-point of the whole war; but
during the political struggle much precious time had
been lost, all enterprise had been paralysed, and all
arrangements dislocated. Thus fresh misfortunes were
still at hand to increase the new minister's difficulties.
In January Loudoun had received the Twenty-second
regiment and the draft sent out to him by Newcastle's
Government; but in April he was still awaiting his
instructions as to the coming campaign, and meanwhile
had little to report but the difficulties thrown by the
Provincial authorities in the way of recruiting.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Pitt's
intention, in deference to Loudoun's own representations,
had been that he should attack Louisburg; and the
seven battalions already referred to had been ordered
to sail to Halifax with that object. These troops had
been embarked on the 17th of March but had been
detained by contrary winds until after the date of Pitt's
dismissal; and though there seems to have been some
effort to get them to sea a few days later, it is none the
less certain that for one reason or another they did not
reach Halifax until July.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Meanwhile Loudoun's
position was most embarrassing. He had withdrawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>all his troops from the frontier to New York, and was
waiting only for news of Admiral Holburne's squadron
and the reinforcements that he might embark and
sail to Halifax to join them. Not a word as to Holburne
reached him; and all that he could discover was
the unwelcome fact that a French fleet, strong enough
to destroy his own escort and sink the whole of his
transports, had been seen off the coast.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> He decided
at last that the risk must be run, embarked his troops
and arrived safely at Halifax, where ten days later he
was joined by Holburne's squadron. The troops were
landed, and then, but not till then, steps were taken to
obtain intelligence as to the condition of Louisburg.
This fact alone enables us to judge of Loudoun's
efficiency as a commander. The first reports received,
though meagre, were encouraging, and the troops were
re-embarked for action; but directly afterwards an
intercepted letter revealed the fact that twenty-two
French sail of the line were in Louisburg harbour, and
that the garrison had been increased to seven thousand
men. The French naval force was so far superior to
Holburne's that any attempt to prosecute the enterprise
was hopeless. The expedition was therefore abandoned,
and the troops sailed back to New York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 31.<br />August 4.<br />August 9.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the disarming of the frontier afforded
Montcalm an opportunity for striking a telling blow.
At the end of July eight thousand French, Canadians
and Indians were assembled at Ticonderoga, and on the
30th twenty-five hundred of them under command of
an officer named Lévis started to march to North-West
Bay on the western shore of Lake George, while Montcalm
with five thousand more embarked in bateaux
on Lake Champlain. On the following day both
divisions united close to Fort William Henry, and on
the 3rd of August Montcalm, mindful of the defeat of
Dieskau, laid siege to the fort in form. Fort William
Henry was an irregular bastioned square, built of crossed
logs filled up with earth and mounting seventeen guns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
On the northern side it was protected by the lake, on
the eastern side by a marsh, and to south and west by
ditches and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevaux de frise</i>. The garrison, which had
been reinforced a few days before in view of coming
trouble, counted a total strength of twenty-two hundred
men, including regular troops, sailors and mechanics,
under the command of a veteran Scottish officer, Lieutenant-Colonel
Monro of the Thirty-fifth Foot. On
the night of the 4th the trenches were opened on the
western side of the fort, and two days later the French
batteries opened fire. The fort returned the fire with
spirit, but it was evident that unless it were speedily
relieved its fall could be only a question of time.
Colonel Webb lay only fourteen miles away at Fort
Edward, and by summoning troops hurriedly from New
York and from the posts on the Mohawk had collected
a force of over four thousand men; but Montcalm was
reported to have twelve thousand men, and Webb did
not think it prudent to advance to Lake George until
further reinforced. He therefore sent a letter to Monro,
advising him to make the best terms that he could,
which was intercepted by Montcalm and politely forwarded
by him to its destination. The siege was pushed
vigorously forward, and by the 8th the besieged were in
desperate straits. Over three hundred men had been
killed and wounded, all the guns excepting a few small
pieces had been disabled, and, worst of all, smallpox
was raging in the fort. On the 9th, therefore, Monro
capitulated on honourable terms, which provided, among
other conditions, that the French should escort the
garrison to Fort Edward. On the march the Indian
allies of the French burst in upon the unarmed British,
unchecked by the Canadian militia, and despite the
efforts of Montcalm and of his officers massacred eighty
of them and maltreated many more. This, however,
though it might well stir the vengeful feelings of the
British, was but an episode. The serious facts were
the loss of the post at Lake George, and yet another
British reverse in North America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">July 26.<br />Sept. 5.</div>

<p>Such were among the last legacies bequeathed by
Newcastle's feebleness; and meanwhile the King's
perversity in driving Pitt from office had brought speedy
judgment upon himself and upon Cumberland. The
Duke was defeated by the French at the battle of
Hastenbeck, and retreating upon Stade concluded, or
rather found concluded for him, the convention of
Klosterzeven, whereby he agreed to evacuate the country.
Such were the discouragements which confronted Pitt
on resuming office. It was hard to see how he could
initiate any operations of value at so late a period of
the year, but there was one species of diversion which,
though little recommended by experience of the past,
lay open to him still, namely a descent upon the French
coast. A young Scottish officer, who had travelled in
France, gave intelligence based on no very careful or
recent observation, that the fortifications of Rochefort
were easily assailable; and Pitt on the receipt of this
intelligence at once conceived the design of surprising
Rochefort and burning the ships in the Charente below
it. Somewhat hastily it was determined to send ten of
the best battalions and a powerful fleet on this enterprise,
and the military command was offered to Lord
George Sackville, who not relishing the task found an
excuse for declining. Pitt was then for entrusting it to
General Henry Conway, but the King objected to this
officer on the score of his youth, and insisted on setting
over him Sir John Mordaunt, a veteran who had showed
merit in the past, but had now lost his nerve and was
conscious that he had lost it. He and Conway alike
objected to the project as based on flimsy and insufficient
information, but both thought themselves bound in
honour to accept the trust confided to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 8.<br />October.</div>

<p>Though the expedition had been decided upon in
July, it was not until two months later that it sailed
from England, and meanwhile the troops waited as
usual in the Isle of Wight.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> There was much delay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
providing transports, and the embarkation was so ill-managed
that the troops were obliged to row a full mile
to their ships. On the 8th of September, however, the
vessels put to sea under convoy of sixteen sail of the
line under Sir Edward Hawke, and after much delay
from foul winds and calms anchored in Basque Roads,
the haven which was to become famous half a century
later for an attack of a very different kind. On the
23rd the fortifications of the Isle d'Aix were battered
down by the fleet and the island itself captured; but
therewith the operations came abruptly to an end.
Fresh information revealed that the French were fully
prepared to meet an attack on Rochefort; and a council
of war decided that any attempt to take it by escalade
would be hopeless. It was therefore decided to attack
the forts at the mouth of the Charente, but the order
was countermanded by Mordaunt; and after a week's
delay Hawke gave the General to understand that unless
operations were prosecuted forthwith he would return
with the fleet to England. The military commanders
thereupon decided that they would return with him,
which on the 1st of October they did, to the huge
indignation of both fleet and army. A court of inquiry
was held over this absurd issue to such extensive and
costly preparations, and Sir John Mordaunt was tried
by court-martial but honourably acquitted. The incident
gave rise to a fierce war of pamphlets. It is certain
that Mordaunt showed remarkable supineness, and he
was suspected of a wish to injure the influence of Pitt
by turning the enterprise into ridicule; but with such
men as Wolfe, Conway and Cornwallis among the senior
officers, the only conclusion is that, in the view of
military men, no object of the least value could have been
gained by any operations whatever. Military opinion
had been against the expedition from the first. Ligonier,
a daring officer but of ripe experience and sound judgment,
wrote of it in the most lukewarm terms as likely
to lead to nothing. On the whole it seems that the
troops were sent on a fool's errand, and that the blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
lay solely with Pitt. The nation was furious, and the
King showed marked coldness towards the generals
who had taken part in the failure; but Pitt, who was
more hurt and disappointed than any one, took no step
except to promote Wolfe, who had advocated active
measures, over the heads of several other officers, and
thus in one way at least extracted good from evil.</p>

<p>So ended the campaigning season of 1757 with an
unbroken record of ill success in every quarter. But
the right man was now at the head of affairs and was
looking about him for the right instruments. The long
period of darkness had come to an end and the light
was about to break, at first in flickering broken rays,
but soon to shine out in one blaze of dazzling and
surpassing splendour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757.</div>

<p class="noindent">Pitt had now a free hand for the execution of such
enterprises as he might desire, a freer hand indeed than
any of his predecessors for ten years past had enjoyed;
for Cumberland, being ill-received by the King on his
return from Hastenbeck, had resigned the Commandership-in-Chief
and all his military appointments of
whatever description. Pitt, conscious that the Duke
had been hardly treated, made no secret of his sympathy
with him; but there can be no doubt that Ligonier,
who succeeded him as Commander-in-Chief, was
infinitely more competent as a military adviser and
more sympathetic as a military colleague. And there
was need for sound military capacity to deal with all
the projects that were ripening in the minister's teeming
brain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 23.<br />December.</div>

<p>Parliament met on the 1st of December, and the
King's speech, after announcing vigorous prosecution
of the war in America and elsewhere, begged for support
for the King of Prussia. Frederick fortunately stood
just at that moment at his highest in the public view,
for his two masterly victories at Rossbach and Leuthen;
and Parliament did not hesitate to confirm a subsidy to
him to enable him to carry on the struggle. But in
other respects Pitt could find little to boast of in the
past year, and he was obliged to confine his eulogy to
Frederick and to Clive, whose victory at Plassey, now
just become known in England, could not be ascribed
to any extraordinary efforts on the part of a British
Ministry. The word "elsewhere" in the King's speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
was understood to signify Hanover, though Pitt warmly
disclaimed any such interpretation of the term; but the
Commons did not quarrel with it nor with the estimates
that were submitted in support of the policy. These
were presented on the 7th of December and showed
a force for the British Establishment of eighty-six
thousand five hundred men, thirty thousand of them for
Gibraltar and the colonies, and the remainder nominally
for service at home. Four thousand of this number,
however, were invalids, who were kept for duties in
garrison only, a system wisely copied from earlier days
and followed from the beginning to the end of the war.
One new regiment only had been raised since the
formation of Fraser's and Montgomery's Highlanders,
namely Colonel Draper's, which had been created for
service in India and which brought up the number of
the regiments of the Line to seventy-nine. Adding
the troops on the Irish to those on the British Establishment
the full numbers of the Army may be set down
roughly at one hundred thousand men. It was soon
to be seen what Pitt could accomplish with them,
when he had found officers who would fulfil his
instructions.</p>

<p>America first occupied his attention and was dealt
with summarily. The first thing to be done was to
recall Lord Loudoun from the command, a resolution
which was carried out before the year's end,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> and to
appoint a new General in his place. The choice fell
upon General James Abercromby, who had been sent
out by Newcastle's Administration; and the selection
was not a fortunate one. The next step was to summon
Colonel Jeffery Amherst from Germany, where he had
been employed since 1756 as Commissary to the Hessian
troops in the pay of England. Amherst, it will be
remembered, was a Guardsman, and was last seen by us
as Ligonier's aide-de-camp on the field of Fontenoy;
so it is at least probable that his appointment was due
to Ligonier's influence. Three new brigadiers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
nominated to serve under him, Lawrence, Whitmore,
and James Wolfe. The operations to be undertaken
in America were threefold. First and foremost Louisburg
was to be besieged; and this duty was assigned to
Amherst with fourteen thousand regular troops. Concurrently
an advance was to be made upon Crown Point,
and pushed forward if possible to Montreal and Quebec;
which service was entrusted to Abercromby, aided by
Brigadier Lord Howe, with about ten thousand regulars
and twenty thousand Provincial troops. Lastly, nineteen
hundred regular troops and five thousand Provincials
under Brigadier-General Forbes were to repair Braddock's
failure and capture Fort Duquêsne.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The number of
Provincial troops to be employed was five times as great
as that provided by the colonies in any previous year;
but Pitt, while asking for so formidable a force, agreed
to supply the troops with tents, provisions, arms, and
ammunition, leaving to the provinces the expenses of
raising, clothing, and paying them only. Moreover,
he had readjusted the former regulations as to the
seniority of Provincial and Imperial officers, which had
given much offence, in a spirit somewhat less to the
prejudice of the Provincials. True to his principle
that British battles should be fought by British subjects
he grudged no expense to gather recruits from the new
British beyond sea.</p>

<p>The troops were to be escorted to America by a
fleet under Admiral Boscawen, which was strong enough
to overpower any French fleet in American waters. A
squadron was also sent under Admiral Osborne to the
Mediterranean to intercept any French reinforcements
from Toulon, while yet another squadron under Sir
Edward Hawke cruised with the like object before
Rochefort. Osborne's name has been forgotten, and
Hawke's lesser services have been swallowed up in the
fame of his action before Quiberon; but it may be said
here once for all that both officers performed their parts
with admirable ability and signal success. The reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
may now begin to judge of Pitt's talent for organising
victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758.<br />Feb. 19.</div>

<p>Boscawen, with twenty-three ships of the line and
several smaller vessels, sailed with his convoy of transports
on the 19th of February. It had been Pitt's hope
that the siege of Louisburg should have been begun by
the 20th of April;<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> but fate was against him, and the
Admiral did not reach Halifax until the 9th of May.
Amherst, who had sailed with Captain George Rodney
in H.M.S. <i>Dublin</i> on the 16th of March, was not
less unlucky in his passage; and Boscawen, after waiting
for his arrival at Halifax until the 28th of May, at last
put to sea without him, but fortunately met the <i>Dublin</i>
just outside the harbour. The huge fleet, one hundred
and fifty-seven sail in all, with eleven thousand troops
on board, then steered eastward, and on the 2nd of June
sailed into Gabarus Bay, immediately to westward of the
tongue of land whereon stood Louisburg. Here there
were three possible landing-places: Freshwater Cove, four
miles from the town; Flat Point, which was rather
nearer; and White Point, which was within a mile of the
ramparts. East of the fortress there was yet another
landing-place named Lorambec. It was determined to
threaten all these points simultaneously, Lawrence and
Whitmore with their respective brigades moving towards
White Point and Flat Point, with one regiment detached
against Lorambec, while Wolfe's brigade should make
a true attack upon Freshwater Cove.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Nothing very
clear was known of the French defences erected to cover
these landing-places, and it so happened that the point
selected for attack was the most strongly defended
of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 8.</div>

<p>For five days all attempts at disembarkation were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>frustrated by fog and storm; but at two o'clock on the
morning of the 8th the troops were got into the boats,
and at daybreak the frigates of the fleet stood in and
opened a fierce fire upon the French entrenchments at
all of the threatened points. A quarter of an hour
later the boats shoved off and pulled for the shore.
Wolfe's party consisted of five companies of grenadiers, a
body of five hundred and fifty marksmen drawn from the
different regiments and known as the Light Infantry,
and a body of American Rangers, with Fraser's Highlanders
and eight more companies of grenadiers in support.
The beach at Freshwater Cove, for which they
were making, was a quarter of a mile long, with rocks
at each end; and on the shore above it more than a
thousand Frenchmen lay behind entrenchments, which
were further covered by abatis. Eight cannon and
swivels had been brought into position to sweep every
portion of the beach and of its approaches, but were
cunningly masked by young evergreen shrubs planted
in the ground before them. The French had not been
at fault when they selected the point remotest from the
town as the most likely to be attacked by an enemy.</p>

<p>The boats were close in-shore before the French
made any sign, when they suddenly opened a deadly fire
of grape and musketry. Wolfe, seeing that a landing in
face of such a tempest of shot would be hopeless, signalled
to the boats to sheer off; but three of them, filled with
Light Infantry on the extreme right, being little exposed
to the fire, pulled on to a craggy point just to eastward
of the beach, which was sheltered from the enemy's
cannon by a small projecting spit. There the three
officers in charge leaped ashore followed by their men, and
Wolfe hastened the rest of his boats to the same spot.
Major Scott, who commanded the Light Infantry, was
the first to reach the land; and though his boat was
stove in against the rocks he scrambled ashore, and with
no more than ten men held his own against six times
his numbers of French and Indians, till other troops
came to his support. The rest of the boats followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
close in his wake. Many were stove in and not a few
capsized; some of the men too were caught by the
surf and drowned; but the greater part made their way
ashore wet or dry, Wolfe, who was armed only with a
cane, leaping into the surf and scrambling over the crags
with the foremost. Arrived at the firm ground beyond,
the men formed, attacked the nearest French battery in
flank, and quickly carried it with the bayonet. Lawrence's
brigade now rowed up, and finding the French
fully occupied with Wolfe, landed at the western end
of the beach with little difficulty or loss. Amherst
followed him; and the French seeing themselves attacked
on right and left, and fearing to be cut off from the
town, abandoned all their guns, some three-and-thirty
pieces great and small, and fled into the woods in the
rear of their entrenchments. The British pursued,
until on emerging from the forest they found themselves
in a cleared space with the guns of Louisburg
opening fire upon them. Then the pursuit was checked,
for the first great object had been obtained. The total
loss of the British little exceeded one hundred in killed,
wounded, and drowned; that of the French was not
much greater, but the British had gained a solid success.</p>

<p>Amherst pitched his camp just beyond range of the
guns of the fortress, and selected Flat Point Cove as the
place for landing his guns and stores. The disembarkation
of material was a task of extreme difficulty and
danger owing to the surf, so much so that over one
hundred boats were stove in during the course of the
siege. The General, therefore, had ample leisure to
examine the ground before him. The harbour of
Louisburg is a land-locked bay with an extreme width
from north-east to south-west of about two and a half
miles. The entrance is rather more than a mile wide,
but is narrowed to less than half of that distance by a
chain of rocky islets. The defences of the entrance
were a battery on a small island on the west side
of the channel and a fort on the eastern shore at the
promontory of Lighthouse Point. Within the harbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
on the northern shore had stood a battery known as the
Grand battery, but this was destroyed by the French on
the night of Amherst's landing; and on the western
shore on a triangular peninsula stood Louisburg itself,
the Dunkirk of America, the apex of the triangle pointing
towards the harbour, the base towards the land
where Amherst's force now lay encamped. The full
circuit of its fortifications was about a mile and a half,
and the number of cannon and mortars mounted thereon
and on the outworks exceeded two hundred. The
garrison consisted of five battalions of regular troops,
numbering about four thousand men, together with
several companies of colonial troops from Canada; the
whole being under command of a gallant officer named
Drucour. Finally, at anchor in the harbour lay five
ships of the line and seven frigates. The strongest
front of the fortress was on the side of the land, running
from the sea on the south to the harbour on the north:
it was made up of four bastions called in succession,
from north to south, the Dauphin's, King's, Queen's, and
Princess's bastions. The King's bastion formed part of
the citadel, and before it the glacis sloped down to
a marsh which protected it completely; but at both
extremities of the line there was high ground favourable
for the works of a besieging force. It was towards the
northern extremity, from a hillock at the edge of the
marsh, that Amherst resolved to push his first attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 25.<br />June 29.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the labour to be accomplished before the
guns and stores could be brought to the spot was
immense. The distance from the landing-place was a
mile and a half, every yard of it consisting of deep mud
covered with moss and water-weeds, through which it
was necessary to make not only a road but an epaulement
also, to protect the road; for a French frigate, the
<i>Aréthuse</i>, lay in a lagoon called the Barachois at the
extreme western corner of the harbour, and swept all the
ground before the ramparts with a flanking fire. While,
therefore, this work was going forward Wolfe was
ordered with twelve hundred men and artillery to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
battery at Lighthouse Point, which had been abandoned
by the French, in order to fire upon the Island battery
and upon the ships in the harbour. After some days the
Island battery was silenced with the help of the fleet,
and the men of war were driven under the guns of
the main fortress. The entrance to the harbour being
thus laid open to the British fleet, the French commander
under cover of a foggy night sank six large ships in
the channel to bar the passage anew.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 9.<br />July 14.<br />July 21.</div>

<p>On the very day when Wolfe succeeded in silencing
the Island battery Amherst's preparations were at last
completed; and the British began to break ground on
the appointed hillock. From thence the trenches were
carried, despite the fire of the <i>Aréthuse</i>, towards the
Barachois; and it was soon evident that the frigate
would be repaid for all the mischief that she had
wrought. At the same time Wolfe broke ground to
the south opposite to the Princess's bastion, and despite
a fierce sortie made by a drunken party of the garrison,
pushed his works steadily forward against it. Another
three weeks saw the net closing tighter and the fire raining
fiercer about the doomed fortress. The <i>Aréthuse</i>,
after sticking to her moorings right gallantly under an
ever increasing fire, was compelled at last to shift her
position. Two days later Wolfe, as busy at the left as
at the right attack, made a dash at nightfall upon some
rising ground only three hundred yards before the
Dauphin's bastion, drove out the French that occupied
it, and would not be forced back by the fiercest fire from
the ramparts. On the 21st a lucky shell fell on one of
the French line-of-battle ships and set her on fire.
The scanty crew left on board of her could not check
the flames. She drifted from her moorings upon two of
her consorts and kindled them also; and all three were
burned to the water's edge. The two remaining line-of-battle
ships survived them but a little time, for a few
nights later six hundred sailors rowed silently into the
harbour and surprised and captured both of them.
One, being aground, was burned, and the other was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
towed off, in contempt of the fire from the fortress, to
a safe anchorage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 27.</div>

<p>By this time Amherst's batteries had reduced Louisburg
almost to defencelessness. The masonry of the
fortress had crumbled under the concussion of its own
guns and was little able to stand the shot of the British.
A new battery erected on the hill to the north of the
Barachois raked the western front of the French works
from end to end, and there was no standing against its
fire. On the 26th of July the last gun on that front
was silenced and a practicable breach had been made.
Drucour then made overtures for a capitulation.
Amherst's reply was short and stern: the garrison must
surrender as prisoners of war, and a definite answer
must be returned within one hour. Drucour replied at
first with defiance, but, before his messenger could
reach Amherst he sent a second emissary to accept the
terms; and on the following day the British occupied
the fortress. The casualties of the besiegers were not
heavy, little exceeding five hundred killed and wounded
of all ranks. The loss of the French is unknown, but
must have been very great, from sickness not less than
from shot and shell. The number of soldiers and sailors
made prisoners amounted to fifty-six hundred, while over
two hundred cannon and a large quantity of munitions
and stores were surrendered with the fortress. So Cape
Breton, and Prince Edward's Island with it, passed
under the dominion of the British for ever.</p>

<p>The siege over, Amherst proposed to Boscawen to
proceed to Quebec, but the Admiral did not consider
the enterprise to be feasible. Drucour's gallant defence,
indeed, had accomplished one object, in preventing
Amherst from co-operating with Abercromby in the
attack on Canada; though, could the siege have been
begun at the date fixed by Pitt, his efforts would have
been of little avail. Amherst therefore left four
battalions to garrison Louisburg,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and sent Colonel
Monckton, Colonel Lord Rollo, and Wolfe, each with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
sufficient force, to complete the work of subjugation on
Prince Edward's Island, the Bay of Fundy, and the Gulf
of St. Lawrence. Wolfe having accomplished his part
of the task went home on sick leave, and Amherst
sailed with five battalions<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> for Boston, where he arrived
on the 14th of September and was received with
immense though rather inconvenient enthusiasm by the
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> His presence was but too sorely needed
to repair the mischief wrought by Abercromby's incapacity.</p>

<p>The prospects of Abercromby at the opening of the
campaign were such as might have encouraged any
General. Vaudreuil, the Governor of Canada, a corrupt
and incapable man, knowing of the intended advance
of the British by Lakes George and Champlain upon
Ticonderoga and Crown Point, had proposed to avert
it by a counter-raid along the Mohawk upon the Hudson.
This plan, being vague, and indeed impracticable, was
abandoned; and the defence of the approaches to
Montreal was committed to Montcalm, who was stationed
at Ticonderoga with an insufficient force of about four
thousand men, and without support from the posts
higher up the lake. To Abercromby, with seven thousand
regular troops and nine thousand Provincials, the
exposure of this weak and isolated force should have
been welcome as the solution of all his difficulties. It
must now be seen to what end he turned so excellent
an opportunity.</p>

<p>The early months of the summer were occupied
with the task, always vexatious and troublesome, of
collecting the Provincial troops, and of sending supplies
up the Mohawk and the Hudson to Fort Edward.
The latter work was tedious and harassing, despite
the facilities of carriage by water, for there were three
portages between Albany and Fort Edward, at each of
which all boats had to be unladen, and dragged, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>with their stores, for three or even more miles overland
before they could be launched again for easier progress.
None the less the business went forward with great
energy; and notwithstanding the danger of convoys
from the attack of Indians when passing through the
forest, the work of escorting was so perfectly managed
that not one was molested. These admirable arrangements
were due to Brigadier Lord Howe, the eldest of
three brothers, all of whom were destined to leave a
mark for good or evil on English history.</p>

<p>Howe had been appointed by Pitt to make good
the failings which were suspected in Abercromby. He
was now thirty-four years of age, and having arrived
in America with his regiment, the Fifty-fifth, in the
previous year, had been at pains to learn the art of
forest-warfare from the most famous leader of the
Provincial irregulars. He threw off all training and
prejudices of the barrack-yard, joined the irregulars in
their scouting-parties, shared the hardships and adopted
the dress of his rough companions and became one of
themselves. Having thus schooled himself he began to
impart the lessons that he had learned to his men. He
made officers and men, alike of regular and of Provincial
troops, throw off all useless encumbrances; he cut the
skirts off their coats and the hair off their heads,
browned the barrels of their muskets, clad their lower
limbs in leggings to protect them from briars, and filled
the empty space in their knapsacks with thirty pounds
of meal, so as to make them independent for weeks
together of convoys of supplies. In a word, he headed
a reaction against the stiff unpractical school of Germany
so much favoured by Cumberland, and tried to equip
men reasonably for the rough work that lay before
them. Such ideas had occurred to other men besides
him. Colonel Bouquet of the Sixtieth wished to dress
his men like Indians, and Brigadier Forbes went cordially
with him, for, as he wrote emphatically, "We must
learn the art of war from the Indians." Washington,
again, said that if the matter were left to his inclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
he would put both men and officers into Indian dress
and set the example himself.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> There was in fact a
general revolt of all practical men against powder and
pipeclay for bush-fighting, and Howe was fortunately
in a position to turn it to account. Possibly it is to
his influence that may be traced the formation in the
same year of a regiment which, being designed for
purposes of scouting and skirmishing only, was clothed
in dark brown skirtless coats without lace of any
description. This corps ranked for a time as the
eightieth of the Line, and was known as Gage's Light
Infantry.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> It must not be supposed that these reforms
were accepted without demur. Officers were dismayed
to find that they were expected to wash their own
clothes without the help of the regimental women, and
to carry their own knives and forks with them according
to Howe's example; and the German soldiers, of whom
there were many in the Sixtieth, sorely resented the
cropping of their heads. But Howe was a strict
disciplinarian, and not the less, but rather the more, on
this account was adored by the men.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">July 5.</div>

<p>By the end of June the whole of Abercromby's
force, with all its supplies, was assembled at the head
of Lake George. On the 4th of July the stores were
shipped, and on the following day the men were embarked.
The arrangements were perfect: each corps
marched to its appointed place on the beach without
the least confusion, and before the sun was well arisen
the whole army was afloat. The scene was indescribably
beautiful. Overhead the sky was blue and
cloudless; the sun had just climbed above the mountain
tops, and his rays slanted down over the vast rolling
slope of forest to the lake. Not a breath of air was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>moving to ruffle the still blue water or stir the banks
of green leaves around it, as the twelve hundred boats
swept over the glassy surface. Robert Rogers, most
famous of American partisans and instructor of Howe,
with his rangers, and Gage with part of his new Light
Infantry led the way. John Bradstreet of New
England followed next with the boatmen, himself the
best boatman among them; and then in three long
parallel columns came the main body of the army.
To right and left blue coats showed the presence of
the Provincial troops of New England and New York,
and in the centre flared the well-known English scarlet.
Howe led this centre column with the Fifty-fifth, his
own regiment; and after him followed the first and
fourth battalions of the Sixtieth, the Twenty-seventh,
Forty-fourth, Forty-sixth, and last of all the Forty-second
with their sombre tartan, each regiment marked
by its flying colours of green or buff or yellow or
crimson. Then, unmarked by any flag, for colours
they had none, came more of Gage's brown coats. Two
"floating castles" armed with artillery also accompanied
this column, towering high above the slender canoes
and whale-boats; and in the rear came the bateaux
laden with stores and baggage, with a rear-guard made
up of red coats and of blue. So the great armament,
stretching almost from shore to shore, crept on over the
bosom of the lake, the strains of fife and drum
mingling with the plashing of ten thousand oars, till
the narrows were reached and the broad front dwindled
into a slender procession six miles in length, still
creeping on like some huge sinuous serpent on its
errand of destruction and death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 6.</div>

<p>By five in the afternoon the flotilla had travelled
five-and-twenty miles, and a halt was made for the
baggage and artillery, which had lagged behind. At
eleven o'clock it started again, and at daybreak reached
the narrow channel that leads into Lake Champlain by
the headland of Ticonderoga. A small advanced post
of the French on the shore was driven back, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
work of disembarkation was begun. By noon the
whole army had been landed on the western shore of
the lake; Rogers with his rangers was sent forward
to reconnoitre, and the troops were formed in four
columns for the march. The route proposed was to
follow the western bank of the channel which connects
Lake George with Lake Champlain, since the French
had destroyed the bridge over it, and to fall upon
Ticonderoga from the rear. The way lay through
virgin forest, encumbered with thick undergrowth and
strewed with the decaying trunks and limbs of fallen
trees. All order became impossible; the men struggled
forward as best they could; the columns got mixed
together; the guides lost all idea of their direction in
the maze; and the army for a time was lost in the
forest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French advanced party, some three
hundred and fifty men, which had fallen back before
the British, found its retreat cut off, and had no resource
but to take to the woods. They too lost
themselves among the trees, and the two hostile bodies
were groping their way helplessly on, when the right
centre column of the British, with Lord Howe and
some rangers at its head, blundered unawares full upon
the French party. A sharp skirmish followed, and
in the general confusion the main body of the British,
hearing volleys but unable to see, became very unsteady.
Fortunately the rangers stood firm, and Rogers'
advanced guard, turning back at the sound of shots,
caught the French between two fires and virtually
annihilated them. The British loss in this affair was
trifling in numbers but none the less fatal to the
expedition; for Lord Howe lay dead with a bullet
through his heart, and with his death the whole soul
of the army expired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 7.</div>

<p>Abercromby's force was for the moment paralysed.
Half of his army was lost, nor did he know where to
find it. So much of it as he could collect he kept
under arms all night, and next morning he fell back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
his landing-place, where to his great relief he found
the rest of his troops awaiting him. Montcalm meanwhile
had been devoured by anxiety. The channel
between Lake George and Lake Champlain being
impassable by boats owing to rapids, the usual route to
Ticonderoga lay across it by some saw-mills at the foot
of the rapids, where he had already destroyed the bridge.
Nevertheless it was not by these saw-mills but on the
western bank of the channel that he had determined
to make his stand; nor was it until the evening of the
6th that, yielding to the advice of two of his officers,
he decided to retire to Ticonderoga. Accordingly, at
noon of the 7th, Abercromby sent Rogers forward
with a detachment to occupy the saw-mills. The bridge
was rebuilt; and the army, crossing the channel late
in the afternoon, occupied the camp deserted by the
French. Abercromby was now within two miles of
Ticonderoga.</p>

<p>But meanwhile Montcalm had not been idle. The
peninsula of Ticonderoga consists of a rocky plateau
with low ground on each side, standing at the junction
of Lakes George and Champlain. The fort stood
near the end of this peninsula; and half a mile to
westward of the spot the ground rises and forms a ridge
across the plateau. On this ridge Montcalm decided
at the last moment to throw up abatis and accept
battle. The outline of the works had already been
traced, and at the dawn of the 7th every man of his
force was at work, cutting down the trees that covered
the ground. The tops were cut off and the logs piled
into a massive breast-work nine feet high, which was
carefully loop-holed. The forest before the breast-work
was also felled and left lying with the tops turned
outwards, as though, to use the words of an eye-witness,
it had been laid low by a hurricane. Between these
felled trees and the breast-work the ground was covered
with heavy boughs, their points being sharpened and
the branches interlaced, so as to present an almost
impenetrable obstacle. The French officers themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
were amazed at the work which had been accomplished
in one day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 8.</div>

<p>Still the position was no Malplaquet, and there was
no occasion for Abercromby to dread it. It was open
to him either to attack Montcalm in his flanks, which
were unfortified; or to bring up his artillery and batter
the breast-work to splinters about his ears; or better
still to post his guns on a height, called Mount Defiance,
which commanded the position, and to rake the breast-work
from end to end; or best of all to mask this
improvised stronghold with a part of his force and
push on with the rest northward up Lake Champlain
and so cut off at once Montcalm's supplies and his
retreat. The French General had but thirty-six hundred
men and only eight days' provisions with him, so that
this movement would have ensured his surrender without
the firing of a shot. Abercromby's intelligence,
however, told him that the French were six thousand
strong and that three thousand more were expected to
join them at any hour; and he was nervously anxious
to make his attack before this reinforcement, which
had in reality no existence, should arrive on the spot.
Accordingly, at dawn of the 8th, Abercromby sent his
engineers to reconnoitre the enemy's position from
Mount Defiance. The duty was most perfunctorily
fulfilled, and the chief engineer, Lieutenant-Colonel
Clark, reported that the works could be captured by
direct assault. This was enough for Abercromby.
Without further inquiry he resolved that the artillery
should be left idle at the place where it had been landed,
and that the abatis should be carried with the bayonet.</p>

<p>It was high noon, and the French were still busily
strengthening their wooden ramparts with earth and
sandbags when shots in the forest before them gave
warning that the British advanced parties had struck
against their picquets. Instantly they fell in behind the
breast-work, three deep, eight battalions of regular
troops and four hundred and fifty Canadians, numbering
in all little more than a fourth of the British force. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
advance of the British was covered by the Light Infantry
and rangers while the columns of attack were forming
under shelter of the forest. Then the skirmishers
cleared the front and the scarlet masses came forward,
solid and steady; the picquets leading, the grenadiers
in support, the battalions of the main body after the
grenadiers, and the Fifty-fifth and Forty-second Highlanders
in reserve. It was little that they could see
through the tangle of fallen trees and dying leaves;
possibly they caught a glimpse of the top of the breast-work
but of not a white coat of the defenders behind it.
On they came in full confidence, knowing nothing of the
obstacles before them, when suddenly the breast-work
broke into a sheet of flame and a storm of grape and
musketry swept the ranks from end to end. Abercromby's
instructions had been that the position should
be taken with the bayonet, but all order was lost in the
maze of fallen trees, and very soon the men began to
return the fire as they advanced, but with little effect,
for not an enemy could they see. Nevertheless,
though riddled through and through, they scrambled
on over the prostrate trunks straight upon the breast-work,
when they were stopped by the tangled hedge and
sharpened boughs of the inner abatis. Strive as they
might they could not force their way through this under
the terrible fire that rained on them in front and flank
from the angles of the breast-work; and after an
hour's struggle they fell back, exclaiming that the
position was impregnable. Reports were sent to Abercromby,
who throughout the action had never moved
from the saw-mills, two miles away, and for all answer
there came back the simple order to attack again.</p>

<p>And then came such a scene as had not been
witnessed since Malplaquet nor was to be seen again till
Badajoz. The men stormed forward anew, furious with
rage and heedless of bullets or grape-shot, through the
network of trunks and boughs against their invisible
enemy. Behind the breast-work the French were cheering
loudly, hoisting their hats occasionally above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
parapet and laughing when they were blown to pieces,
but pouring in always a deadly and unquenchable fire;
while the British struggled on, grimed with sweat and
smoke, vowing that they would have that wooden wall
at any cost. The Highlanders broke loose from the
reserve with claymores drawn and slashed their way
through the branches to the breast-work, and the British
rushed after them to its foot but could advance no
further. They had no ladders, and as fast as they
hoisted one another to the top of the breast-work
they were shot down. Montcalm, cool and collected,
moved to and fro among his men in his shirt-sleeves,
always at the point of greatest danger, to cheer them and
keep them to the fight. The French fire was appalling
in its destruction. Men who had passed through the
ordeal of Fontenoy declared that it was child's play
compared with Ticonderoga. Nevertheless not once
only, but thrice more, the British and the Americans with
them hurled themselves desperately against the French
stronghold, only to be beaten back time after time, until
the inner abatis was hung with wisps of scarlet, like
poppies that grow through a hedge of thorn, some swaying
with the contortions that told of living agony, some
limp and still in the merciful stillness of death. The
fight had endured for five hours, when some officer of
more intelligence than his fellows formed two columns
and made a fifth attack upon the extreme right of the
French position. The men hewed their way to the
breast-work, and for a time the fate of this unequal day
hung trembling in the balance. Montcalm hurried to
the threatened quarter with his reserves, but only by
desperate exertion held his own, for the Highlanders
fought with a fury that would yield neither to discipline
nor to death. Captain John Campbell and a few of his
men actually scaled the wooden wall and dropped down
within it, but only to be pierced at once by a score of
bayonets. Finally at six o'clock a last attack was
delivered, as heroic, as hopeless, and as fruitless as the
rest; and then the order was given to retreat. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Highlanders were with the greatest difficulty forced
away from their fallen comrades, and under cover of
the skirmishers' fire the British withdrew, shattered,
exhausted, and demoralised.</p>

<p>And then came one of those strange and dreadful
scenes which break an officer's heart. Hardly was the
retreat sounded when the very men who for six hours
had faced the mouth of hell without flinching were
seized with panic and fled in wild disorder through
forest and swamp to the landing-place, leaving their
arms, their accoutrements, the very shoes from their feet
to mark the track of their flight. Fortunately Bradstreet
and his armed boatmen mounted guard over the
boats and prevented the fugitives from setting themselves
afloat. Abercromby came up, as abject as the worst,
despatched orders for the wounded and the heavy
artillery to be sent back to New York, and followed
himself so speedily with his humiliated troops that
he arrived at the head of Lake George before his
messenger. There he entrenched himself and sat still,
while the reckoning of his ignorance and folly was
made up. Of the Provincial troops three hundred and
thirty-four had fallen before Ticonderoga; of the seven
British battalions no fewer than sixteen hundred. The
Forty-second lost close on five hundred men and officers
killed and wounded, the Forty-fourth and Forty-sixth
each about two hundred, the Fifty-fifth and the fourth
battalion of the Sixtieth each about one hundred and
fifty, the Twenty-seventh and first battalion of the
Sixtieth each about a hundred. The loss of the French
was less than three hundred and fifty, and Montcalm
might well praise his gallant soldiers and hug himself
over his victory, for he had fended off attack on Canada
for at least one year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August.</div>

<p>The French General contented himself with
strengthening the defences of Ticonderoga and sending
out parties of irregulars to harass Abercromby's communications
with Fort Edward. Abercromby for his
part remained throughout July and the first days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
August glued to his camp at the head of Lake George,
losing many men from dysentery but attempting
nothing. At last he made over to Bradstreet a force
of twenty-five hundred men, Provincial troops for the
most part, and sent him to attack the French post of
Fort Frontenac, which guarded the outlet of Lake
Ontario into the St. Lawrence. The project was
Bradstreet's own and had been favourably regarded
some time before by Loudoun; but it was only under
pressure of a council of war that Abercromby's assent
to it was wrung from him. Bradstreet accordingly
dropped down to Albany, and advanced by the Mohawk
and Onandaga to the site of Oswego, where he launched
out on to the lake on the 22nd of August, and on the
25th landed safely near Fort Frontenac. The French
garrison being little over one hundred strong could
make small resistance, and on the 27th surrendered as
prisoners of war, leaving nine vessels, which constituted
the entire naval force of the French on the lake, in
Bradstreet's hands. The fort was dismantled, two of
the ships were carried off, the remainder were burned
since there was no fort at Oswego to protect them, and
Bradstreet returned triumphant to Albany. The service
that he had rendered was of vast importance. The
command of Lake Ontario was lost to the French,
their communications north and south were severed,
the alliance of a number of wavering Indian tribes was
secured for the British, and Fort Duquêsne, the point
against which Pitt had levelled his third blow, was left
isolated and alone.</p>

<p>Heartened by this success and by the news of
Louisburg, Abercromby began to write vaguely of a
second attempt upon Ticonderoga<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> as soon as Amherst
should have reinforced him; but it was October before
the conqueror of Louisburg reached Lake George, and
then both commanders agreed that the season was too
far spent for further operations. The troops were
accordingly sent into winter quarters, and Canada was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
saved for another year. It now remains to be seen how
matters fared with Brigadier Forbes at Fort Duquêsne.</p>

<p>Forbes himself had arrived at Philadelphia early in
April, to find that no army was ready for him. The
Provincial troops allotted to him from Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina had not even
been enlisted; Montgomery's Highlanders were in the
south, and only half of Colonel Bouquet's battalion of
the Sixtieth was within reach. It was the end of June
before the various fractions of his force were on march:
and meanwhile the General was seized with a dangerous
and agonising internal disease, against which he fought
with a courage and resolution which was as admirable
as it was pathetic. Forbes's career had been somewhat
singular. He hailed from county Fife and had begun
life as a medical student, but had entered the Scots
Greys as a cornet and had risen to command the regiment.
He had served in Flanders and Germany on
the staff of Stair, Ligonier, and General Campbell, and
finally as Cumberland's quartermaster-general.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> But
though all his training had been in the old formal
school he had recognised, as has been seen, that in
America he must learn a new art of war. He had
studied Braddock's failure, and had perceived that even
if Braddock had succeeded he must inevitably have
retired from Fort Duquêsne from want of supplies.
Instead, therefore, of making one long march with an
unmanageable train of waggons, he decided to advance
by short stages, establishing fortified magazines at every
forty miles, and at last, when within reach of his destination,
to march upon it with his entire force and with as
few encumbrances as possible. This plan he had learned
from a French treatise,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> though he might have gathered
it from a study of Monk's campaign in the Highlands
had the opportunity been open to him. Nor was
Bouquet, a Swiss by nationality, less assiduous in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>thinking out new methods. His views as to equipment
have already been noticed; but knowing the value of
marksmanship in the woods, Bouquet obtained a certain
number of rifled carbines for his own battalion, and
thus turned a part of the Sixtieth into Riflemen before
their time.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> He also introduced a new system of drill
for work in the forest, forming his men into small
columns of two abreast which could deploy into line in
two minutes. Under such commanders the mistakes of
Braddock were not likely to be repeated.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>Then came the question whether Braddock's route
should be followed, or a new but shorter line of advance
from Pennsylvania. Virginia was furiously jealous lest
Pennsylvania should reap the advantage of a direct road
to the trading station on the Ohio, and Washington was
urgent in recommending the old road; but Forbes had
no respect for provincial squabbles and decided for
Pennsylvania. He had much difficulty in shaping the
Provincials into soldiers, the material delivered to him
being of the rawest, and destitute of the remotest idea of
discipline. It was not till the beginning of July that
Bouquet with an advanced party encamped at Raystown,
now the town of Bedford, on the eastern slope of the
Alleghanies, and that Forbes was able to move to the
frontier village of Carlisle and thence to Shippensburg.
There his illness increased, with pain so excruciating
that he was unable to advance farther until September.
Bouquet meanwhile pushed forward the construction of
a road over the Alleghanies with immense labour and
under prodigious difficulties. The wildness and desolation
of the country seems somewhat to have awed even
the stern resolution of Forbes. "It is an immense uninhabited
wilderness," he wrote to Pitt, "overgrown
everywhere with trees or brushwood, so that nowhere
can one see twenty yards." Through this with its endless
obstacles of jungle, ravine, and swamp Bouquet's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>men worked their way. The first fortified magazine
had been made at Raystown and named Fort Bedford;
the next was to be on the western side of the main river
Alleghany at a stream called Loyalhannon Creek.
Progress was necessarily slow, but Forbes's advance was
not made so leisurely without an object. The French
had collected a certain number of Indians for the
defence of Fort Duquêsne; but if the attack were
delayed it was tolerably certain that these fickle and unstable
allies would grow tired of waiting and disperse
to their homes. Forbes meanwhile lost no opportunity
of conciliating these natives; and by the efforts of his
emissaries the most powerful tribes were persuaded to
join the side of the British, and scornfully to reject the
rival overtures of the French.</p>

<p>But at this critical time a rash exploit of one of
Bouquet's officers went near to wreck the whole enterprise.
Major Grant of the Highlanders entreated
permission to go forward with a small party to reconnoitre
Fort Duquêsne, capture a few prisoners, and
strike some blow which might discourage and weaken
the French. Eight hundred men of the Highlanders,
Sixtieth, and Provincial troops were accordingly made
over to him; so setting out with these from Loyalhannon
he arrived before dawn of the 14th of September
at a hill, since named Grant's hill, within half a mile of
the fort. With incredible rashness he scattered his
force in all directions. Leaving a fourth of his men to
guard the baggage, he sent parties out to right and left,
took post himself two miles in advance of the baggage
with a hundred men, and sent an officer forward with a
company of Highlanders into the open plain to draw a
map of the fort. Finally, as if to call attention to his
own folly, he ordered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reveillé</i> to be beaten with all
possible parade. The French and Indians at once
swarmed out of the fort and drove all the parties back
in confusion upon one another. The Highlanders were
seized with panic at the yells of the Indians and took to
their heels, and but for the firmness of the Virginians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of the baggage-guard the whole force would probably
have been cut to pieces. As it was, nearly three hundred
men were killed, wounded, or taken, and Grant himself
was among the prisoners. Forbes, who amid all
torments, troubles, and reverses preserved always a
keen sense of the ridiculous, declared that he could
make nothing of the affair except that his friend Grant
had lost his wits; which indeed was a concise and
accurate summary of the whole proceeding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 18.<br />Nov. 25.</div>

<p>But such paltry success could avail the French little,
for Bradstreet's capture of Fort Frontenac had already
decided the fate of Fort Duquêsne. The French
commander, his supplies being cut off, was obliged to
dismiss the greater number of his men; otherwise
Forbes could hardly have penetrated to the Ohio in
that year. The elements fought for the French.
Heavy rain ruined Bouquet's new road; the horses
being underfed and overworked kept breaking down
fast; the magazines at Raystown and Loyalhannon were
emptied faster than they could be replenished; and
Forbes was in despair. All through October the rain
continued until at length it gave place to snow, and the
roads became a sea of mud over which retreat and
advance were alike impossible. At the beginning of
November the General, though now sick unto death,
was carried to Loyalhannon, where he decided that no
attack could be attempted for that season. Intelligence,
however, was brought that the French were so weak in
numbers as to be defenceless; and on the 18th, twenty-five
hundred picked men marched off without tents or
baggage, Forbes himself travelling in a litter at their
head. At midnight of the 24th the sentries heard the
sound of a distant explosion, and on the next day at
dusk the troops reached the blackened ruins of what
had been Fort Duquêsne. The fortifications had been
blown up; barracks and store-houses were in ashes;
there was no sign of anything human except the heads
of the Highlanders who had been killed in Grant's
engagement, stuck up on poles with their kilts hung in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
derision round them. Their Highland comrades went
mad with rage at the sight; but the French and their
allies were gone, having evacuated and destroyed the
fort and retired to the fort of Venango farther up the
Alleghany river. Forbes planted a stockade around a
cluster of huts that were still undestroyed, and named
it Pittsburg in honour of the minister. Arrangements
were then made for leaving a garrison of two hundred
Provincials to hold the post, for there could be no
doubt that the French would collect a force from
Venango and Niagara to endeavour to retake it. The
garrison indeed was far too small, but there was not
food enough for more; so this handful of poor men
was left perforce to make the best of its solitude during
the dreary days of the winter.</p>

<p>One duty still remained to be done before Forbes's
column turned homeward,&mdash;to search for the bones
of those who had fallen with Braddock. A party of
Pennsylvanians made their way through the forest to the
Monongahela, Major Halket of Forbes's staff accompanying
them. Among the multitude of ghastly relics
two skeletons were found lying together under one tree.
Halket recognised the one by a peculiarity of the teeth
as that of his father, Sir Peter Halket of the Forty-fourth;
and in the other he thought that he saw his brother,
who had fallen by his side. The two were wrapped in
a Highlander's plaid and buried in one grave, under a
volley fired by the Pennsylvanians. The rest of the
remains were buried together in one deep trench; and
then at the beginning of December the troops marched
back to Pennsylvania with the dying Forbes in their
midst. With great difficulty the General was brought
still living to Philadelphia, where he lingered on through
the winter and died in the following March. Though
no brilliant action marked his advance to the Ohio he
had accomplished his work against endless difficulties
and in extremity of bodily torture; and that work was
the taking from France of half of her Indian allies,
the relief of the western border from Pennsylvania to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Maryland from Indian raids, and the opening to the
British of the vast regions of the West.</p>

<p>So ended the American campaign of 1758. The
French had been struck hard on both flanks, at Louisburg
in the north and on the Ohio in the south, but in
the centre they had held their own. Two parts out of
three of Pitt's design had been accomplished; but the
most important success of all was that achieved by
Bradstreet in severing the French communications at
Fort Frontenac. It may be that Pitt thought best to
adhere to the plan of operations mapped out for him by
Loudoun, or it may be that he wished to retrieve the
reputation lost by Braddock's defeat; but the fact
remains that he meditated no attack on Niagara or Fort
Frontenac, the capture of either of which would have
entailed that of Fort Duquêsne, and that despite the
industry of Bouquet and the tenacity of Forbes the
advance to the Ohio would have been impossible but
for the brilliant and successful enterprise of Bradstreet.</p>

<p class="noindent">The reader will probably have been struck during the
narrative of the American campaign of 1758 with the
inferiority of the French in numbers to the British at
every point. The French colonies were in fact allowed
to take their chance, while French soldiers were poured
by the hundred thousand into Germany to avenge King
Frederick's sarcasm against Madame de Pompadour.
A Pitt was hardly needed to perceive that the more
employment that could be found for French armies in
Europe, the fewer were the men which could be spared
for the service of France's possessions beyond sea; and
Pitt resolved accordingly to keep those armies fully
occupied. By the convention of Klosterzeven, as has
already been told, it was agreed that the Hanoverian
army should be broken up; but even before Cumberland's
return to England, the question of repudiating
that convention had been broached, and a fortnight
later a message was despatched to Frederick announcing
that the army would take the field again, and requesting
the services of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick as
General-in-Chief. Frederick assented; and on the 24th
of November Ferdinand arrived at Stade, fresh from
the victory of Rossbach in which he had taken part
three weeks before, to assume the command. The
whole aspect of affairs changed instantly, as if by
magic. Setting his force in motion at once Ferdinand
by the end of the year had driven the French back to
the Aller, and renewing operations after six weeks spent
in winter-quarters pressed the enemy still farther back,
even across the Rhine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">June 5.<br />June 7.<br />June 29.<br />July 1.</div>

<p>It is said that even before Ferdinand had achieved
this success Pitt had resolved to reinforce him with
British troops, but for the present the minister reverted
to his old plan of a descent on the French coast, which
might serve the purpose of diverting French troops
alike from America and from Germany. The first sign
of his intention was seen in April, when the officers of
sixteen battalions received orders to repair to the Isle
of Wight by the middle of May. Such long notice
was a strange preliminary for a secret expedition, for
the troops themselves did not receive their orders until
the 20th of May; and it was the end of the month
before the whole of them, some thirteen thousand men,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
were encamped on the island. The Duke of Marlborough
was selected for the command, and, since his
military talent was doubtful, Lord George Sackville,
whose ability was unquestioned, was appointed as his
second, with the duty of organising the whole of the
operations. Two squadrons, comprising twenty-four
ships of the line under Lord Anson, Sir Edward Hawke,
and Commodore Howe, were detailed to escort the
transports, and on the 1st of June the armament set
sail, arriving on the 5th at Cancalle Bay, about eight
miles from St. Malo. A French battery, erected for
the defence of the bay, was quickly silenced by the ships,
and on the following day the entire army was landed.
One brigade was left to guard the landing-place, and
the remainder of the force marched to St. Malo, where
the light dragoons under cover of night slipped down
to the harbour and burned over a hundred privateers
and merchant-vessels. The Duke of Marlborough then
made dispositions as if for the siege of St. Malo, but
hearing that a superior force was on the march to cut
off his retreat, retired to Cancalle Bay, re-embarked the
troops, and sailed against Granville, a petty town some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
twenty miles to north-east of St. Malo. Foul weather
frustrated the intended operations; and on the 27th
the expedition arrived off Havre de Grace. Preparations
were made for landing, but after two days of
inactivity Marlborough decided against an attack,
and the fleet bore up for Cherbourg. There once
more all was made ready for disembarkation, but the
weather was adverse, forage and provisions began to
fail, and the entire enterprise against the coast was
abandoned. So the costly armament returned to Portsmouth,
having effected absolutely nothing. It is, however,
doubtful whether blame can be attached to the
officers, either naval or military, for the failure. Pitt
had procured no intelligence as to the dispositions of
the French for defence of the threatened ports; so that
a General might well hesitate to run the risk of landing,
when he could not tell how soon he might find himself
cut off by a superior force from the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 23.<br />Aug. 21.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Ferdinand following up his success had
pursued the French over the Rhine and gained a signal
victory over them at Creveld. This action appears to
have hastened Pitt to a decision, for within four days he
announced to the British Commissary at Ferdinand's
headquarters the King's intention to reinforce the
Prince with two thousand British cavalry. The troops
were warned for service on the same day; but within
three days it was decided to increase the reinforcement
to six thousand troops,<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> both horse and foot, and a week
later the force was further augmented by three battalions.
The first division of the troops was shipped off to Emden
on the 11th of July, and by the second week in August
the entire reinforcement had disembarked at the same
port under command of the Duke of Marlborough,
joining Prince Ferdinand's army at Coesfeld on the
21st.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> There for the present we must leave them, till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>the time comes for Ferdinand's operations to engage our
whole attention. Meanwhile the reader need bear in
mind only that the British Army is definitely committed
to yet another theatre of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August.</div>

<p>Even so, however, Pitt remained unsatisfied without
another stroke against the French coast. While the
troops were embarking for Germany he had formed a
new encampment on the Isle of Wight and was intent
upon a raid on Cherbourg. So intensely distasteful were
these expeditions to the officers of the Army that the
Duke of Marlborough and Lord George Sackville used
their interest to obtain appointment to the army in
Germany, so as to be quit of them once for all. The
result was that when Lieutenant-General Bligh, who had
been originally selected to serve under Prince Ferdinand,
arrived in London from Ireland to sail for Emden, he
found to his dismay that his destination was changed,
and that he must prepare to embark for France. He
accepted the command as in duty bound, the more so
since Prince Edward was to accompany the expedition,
but he was little fit for the service, having no qualification
except personal bravery and one great disqualification
in advanced age. Accordingly, obedient but
unwilling, he set sail on the 1st of August with twelve
battalions<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> and nine troops of light dragoons, escorted
by a squadron under Commodore Howe. Not yet had
the gallant sailor learned of his succession to the title
through the fall of his brother Lord Howe at the head
of Lake Champlain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 16.<br />September.</div>

<p>The expedition began prosperously enough. The
fleet arrived before Cherbourg on the 6th and at once
opened the bombardment of the town. Early next
morning it sailed to the bay of St. Marais, two leagues
from Cherbourg, where the Guards and the grenadier-companies,
having landed under the fire of the ships,
attacked and drove off a force of three thousand French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
which had been drawn up to oppose them. The rest of
the troops disembarked without hindrance on the following
day and advanced on Cherbourg, which being unfortified
to landward surrendered at once. Bligh thereupon
proceeded to destroy the docks and the defences of the
harbour and to burn the shipping, while the light cavalry
scoured the surrounding country and levied contributions.
This done, the troops were re-embarked; and after
long delay owing to foul winds the fleet came to anchor
on the 3rd of September in the Bay of St. Lunaire, some
twelve miles east of St. Malo. There the troops were
again landed during the two following days, though not
without difficulty and the loss of several men drowned.
Bligh's instructions bade him carry on operations against
Morlaix or any other point on the coast that he might
prefer to it, and he had formed some vague design of
storming St. Malo from the landward side. This, however,
was found to be impracticable with the force at
his disposal; and now there ensued an awkward complication.
The weather grew steadily worse, and Howe
was obliged to warn the General that the fleet must
leave the dangerous anchorage at St. Lunaire, and that
it would be impossible for him to re-embark the troops
at any point nearer than the bay of St. Cast, a few
miles to westward. Accordingly he sailed for St. Cast,
while Bligh, now thrown absolutely on his own resources
ashore, marched for the same destination overland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 9.</div>

<p>The army set out on the morning of the 7th of
September, and after some trouble with small parties of
French on the march encamped on the same evening
near the river Equernon, intending to ford it next
morning. It speaks volumes for the incapacity of Bligh
and of his staff that the passage of the river was actually
fixed for six o'clock in the morning, though that was
the hour of high water. It was of course necessary to
wait for the ebb-tide; so it was not until three in the
afternoon that the troops forded the river, even then
waist-deep, under a brisk fire from small parties of
French peasants and regular troops. Owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
lateness of the hour further advance on that day was
impossible; and on resuming the march on the following
morning the advanced guard encountered a body of
about five hundred French troops. The enemy were
driven back with considerable loss, but their prisoners
gave information of the advance of at least ten thousand
French from Brest. Arrived at Matignon Bligh encamped
and sent his engineers to reconnoitre the beach
at St. Cast in case he should be compelled to retreat.
Deserters who came in during the night reported that
the French were gathering additional forces from the
adjacent garrisons; and in the morning Bligh sent word
to Howe that he intended to embark on the following
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 11.</div>

<p>Constant alarms during the night showed that the
enemy was near at hand; and it would have been
thought that Bligh, having made up his mind to retreat,
would in so critical a position have retired as swiftly and
silently as possible. On the contrary, at three o'clock on
the morning of the 11th the drums beat the assembly as
usual, to give the French all the information that they
desired; while the troops moved off in a single column
so as to consume the longest possible time on the march.
It was nine o'clock before the embarkation began, and
at eleven, when two-thirds of the force had been shipped,
the enemy appeared in force on the hills above the
beach. For some time the French were kept at a distance
by the guns of the fleet, but after an hour they
found shelter and opened a sharp and destructive fire.
General Drury, who commanded the rear-guard, consisting
of fourteen hundred men of the Guards and the
grenadiers, was obliged to form his men across the
beach to cover the embarkation. Twice he drove back
the enemy, but, ammunition failing, he was forced back in
turn, and there was nothing left but a rush for the boats.
The French bringing up their artillery opened a furious
fire; and all was confusion. So many of the boats
were destroyed that the sailors shrank from approaching
the shore and were only kept to their work by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
personal example of Howe. In all seven hundred and
fifty officers and men were killed and wounded, General
Drury being among the slain, and the rest of the rear-guard
were taken prisoners. The fleet and transports
made their way back to England in no comfortable
frame of mind, for the French naturally magnified their
success to the utmost; and so ended Pitt's third venture
against the coast of France.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt but that Bligh must be
held responsible for the failure. It should seem indeed
that he was ignorant of the elements of his duty, even
to the enforcing of discipline among the troops, who
at the first landing near Cherbourg behaved disgracefully.
The Duke of Marlborough had met with the
same trouble at Cancalle Bay, but had had at least the
strength to hang a marauding soldier on the first day
and so to restore order. But after all Pitt was presumably
responsible for the selection of Bligh; or, if
he was aware that he could not appoint the right man
for such a service, he would have done better to
abandon these raids on the French coast altogether.
The conduct of Marlborough and Sackville in shirking
the duty because it was distasteful to them does not
appear commendable; but Sackville at any rate was
no fool, and Pitt might at least have recognised the
military objections that were raised against his plans.
The truth of the matter is, as Lord Cochrane was to
prove fifty years later, that sporadic attacks on the
French coast are best left to the Navy; for a single
frigate under a daring and resolute officer can paralyse
more troops than an expedition of ten or fifteen
thousand men, with infinitely less risk and expense.
Pitt had not yet done with his favourite descents, but
his next venture of the kind was to be directed against
an island instead of the mainland, when the British
fleet could interpose between his handful of battalions
and the whole population of France. Meanwhile
Cherbourg had at any rate been destroyed, so like a
wise man the minister made the most of this success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
by sending some of the captured guns with great
parade through Hyde Park to the Tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 30.<br />Oct. 26.<br />Dec. 29.</div>

<p>The operations already narrated of the year 1758
were of considerable scope, embracing as they did the
advance of three separate armies in America, two raids
on the French coast, and the despatch of British troops
to Germany; but these by no means exhaust the tale.
There were few quarters of the globe in which the
British had not to complain of French encroachment,
and to this insidious hostility Pitt had resolved to put
a stop once for all. Five years before, the merchants
of Africa had denounced the unfriendliness of the
French on the Gambia, who were building forts and
stirring up the natives against them. The Royal
African Company also, with its monopoly of the slave-trade,
was anxious for its line of fortified depôts on
the West Coast, and prayed to be delivered from its
troublesome neighbours at Senegal and in the island
of Goree.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> One of Pitt's first actions in 1758 was to
order an expedition to be prepared against Senegal, a
duty for which two hundred marines and twenty-five
gunners were deemed a sufficient force. On the 23rd
of April Captain Marsh of the Royal Navy sailed into
the Senegal river, and by the 30th Fort Louis had
surrendered and was flying the British flag. Two
hundred men of Talbot's regiment<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> were at once sent
to garrison the new possession, and then for some
months there was a pause, while the troops for Germany
and Cherbourg were embarking for their destinations.
But no sooner was Bligh's expedition returned than a
new enterprise was set on foot, and Captain Keppel of
the Royal Navy received secret instructions to convoy
Lieutenant-Colonel Worge with Forbes's regiment<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
and two companies of the Sixty-sixth to the West
Coast.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> Within three weeks the troops were embarked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>at Kinsale, and by the 28th of December Keppel's
squadron was lying off Goree. On the following day
the ships opened fire on the French batteries, and at
nightfall the island surrendered, yielding up over three
hundred prisoners and nearly an hundred guns. So
with little trouble were gained the West African
settlements of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759.<br />Jan. 13.<br />Jan. 15.</div>

<p>But even before Keppel had received his instructions
six more battalions<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> were under orders for foreign
service; and his squadron had hardly sailed before
another fleet of transports was gathering at Portsmouth.
Major-General Peregrine Hopson, who had
been Governor at Nova Scotia in the difficult years
that preceded the outbreak of war, was appointed to
the chief command, and Colonel Barrington, a junior
officer, was, despite the honourable protests of his
brother, the Secretary-at-War, selected to be his
second. The expedition was delayed beyond the date
fixed for its departure by bad weather, but at length
on the 12th of November the transports, escorted
by eight ships of the line under Commodore Hughes,
got under way and sailed with a fair wind to the
west. On the 3rd of January 1759 they reached
Barbados, the time-honoured base of all British operations
in the West Indies, and there was Commodore
Moore waiting with two more ships of the line to join
them and to take command of the fleet. After ten
days' stay they again sailed away north-westward before
the trade-wind. Astern of them the mountains of St.
Vincent hung distant like a faint blue cloud; ahead of
them two tall peaks, shaped like gigantic sugar-loaves,
rose higher and higher from the sea, and marked
the southern end of St. Lucia. Then St. Lucia came
abeam, a rugged mass of volcanic mountains shrouded
heavily in tropical forest, and another island rose up
broad and blue not many leagues ahead, an island
which the men crowded forward to see, for they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
told that it was Martinique. Still the fleet held on; St.
Lucia was left astern and Martinique loomed up larger
and bolder ahead; then an islet like a pyramid was
passed on the starboard hand, the Diamond Rock, not
yet His Majesty's Ship; a little farther and the fleet
was under the lee of the island; yet a little farther and
the land shrank back to eastward into a deep inlet
ringed about by lofty volcanic hills, and a few useless
cannon-shot from a rocky islet near the entrance
proclaimed that the French were ready for them in
the Bay of Fort Royal.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 16.<br />Jan. 17.</div>

<p>The ships lay off the bay until the next day, while
Hopson thought out his plan of operations. The town
and fortress of Fort Royal lies well within the bay on
the northern shore, so Negro Point, which marks the
entrance to the harbour to the north, was the spot
selected for the landing. The ships next morning stood
in and silenced two small batteries mounted at the
Point, and in the afternoon the troops landed unopposed
in a small bay adjacent to it. A camping
ground was chosen in the only open space that could be
found, between two ravines, and there the army passed
the night formed up in square, to be ready against any
sudden attack. At dawn of the next morning shots
were heard, and the outposts reported that the enemy
was advancing and entrenching a house close to the
British position. The grenadiers were sent forward to
dislodge them, and a smart skirmish ended in the retreat
of the French. Hopson would fain have pushed
more of his men into action, but the jungle was so
dense that they could find no enemy. "Never was
such a country," wrote the General plaintively, "the
Highlands of Scotland for woods, mountains, and continued
ravines are nothing to it."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> As it was plainly
out of the question to attempt to drag the heavy
artillery before Fort Royal over such a country, it was
decided to re-embark the troops forthwith. Nearly one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>hundred men had been killed and wounded in the
morning's skirmish, but the embarkation was accomplished
without further loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 18.</div>

<p>On the following day the fleet coasted the island
northward and by evening lay off St. Pierre, the second
town in Martinique, which stood nestling in a little
plain at the head of a shallow bay. The men-of-war
stood in on the next morning to observe the defences of
the place, and the fire of the French batteries from the
heights to right and left soon convinced the Commodore
that the town could not be taken without such damage
to his ships as would disable them for further service.
It was therefore resolved that Martinique should for the
present be left alone, and that the expedition should
proceed to Guadeloupe, which was not only the richest
of the French Islands but the principal nest of French
privateers in the West Indies. So the fleet steered
northward once more past Dominica, where the white
flag of the Bourbons yet floated over the fort of Roseau;
while a single ship was sent forward with the chief
military engineer on board to reconnoitre the town of
Basseterre, which lies on the western or leeward coast a
few miles to north of the most southerly point of
Guadeloupe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 23.<br />Jan. 24.<br />Jan.</div>

<p>The engineer returned with no very encouraging
report. The town though lying on an open roadstead
was well fortified, and all the approaches to it along the
coast were well protected, while the fort of Basseterre,
situated on a lofty eminence at the southern end, was
declared to be impregnable by the attack of ships alone.
Moore, however, was resolute that the town could and
should be taken, and at ten o'clock on the morning of
the 23rd the ships of the line and bomb-ketches opened
a heavy fire on the fort and batteries. In a few hours
the town, crammed with the sugar and rum of the past
harvest, was burning furiously, and by nightfall every
battery was silenced and the town was a heap of
blackened ruins. At dawn of the morrow the troops
were landed, to find the elaborate lines of defence inland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
deserted and every gun spiked, while desultory shots
from among the sugar-canes alone told of the presence
of the enemy. The army encamped in Basseterre, but
the firing from the cane-fields increased, and picquets
and advanced posts were harassed to death by incessant
alarms and petty attacks. Hopson sent a summons to
the French Governor to surrender, but received only an
answer of defiance. The Governor had in fact withdrawn
his force some six miles from Basseterre to an
impregnable position such as can be found only in a
rugged, mountainous and untamed country. Each flank
was covered by inaccessible hills clothed with impenetrable
forest; in his front ran the river Galeon with
high and precipitous banks, and beyond the river a
gully so steep and sheer that the French themselves
used ladders to cross it. The position was further
strengthened by entrenchments and cannon. To attack
it in front was impossible. The only practicable
access was by a narrow road which led through dense
forest upon one flank; and this was most carefully
guarded. Here therefore the French commander lay,
refusing to come to action but sending out small
parties to worry the British outposts, in the hope that
the climate would do the work of repelling his enemy
for him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feb. 14.</div>

<p>Nor was he without good ground for such hope;
for Hopson was in great doubt whether it would not be
more expedient for him to re-embark. His own health
was failing rapidly, and the men were beginning to fall
down fast under the incessant work at the advanced
posts and the fatigue of carrying provisions to them.
From the day of landing it had been found necessary to
push these advanced posts farther and farther inland
and to make them stronger and stronger, until at last
they embraced a circuit of fully three miles. By the
end of January the men on the sick list numbered
fifteen hundred, or fully a quarter of the force. Hopson
sent six hundred invalids to Antigua in the hope of
saving at least some of them, but therewith his efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
came to an end, nor could all the representations of
Barrington stimulate him to further action. Yet new
operations were by no means difficult either of conception
or of execution. Guadeloupe is in reality not one
island but two, being divided by a narrow strait known
as the Salt River. It is very much of the shape of
a butterfly with wings outspread, flying south; the
western wing being known as Guadeloupe proper and
the eastern as Grande Terre, while the Salt River runs
in the place of the butterfly's body. Grande Terre, the
most fertile part of the island, still lay open to attack,
with an excellent harbour at Point à Pitre, of which
the principal defence, Fort Louis, could be reached by
the cannon of ships. Moore being fortunately independent
of Hopson in respect of naval operations,
sent ships round to Fort Louis, which speedily battered
it into surrender, and installed therein a garrison of
three hundred Highlanders and Marines. But even
with this new base secured to him Hopson declined to
move. He was indeed sick unto death, and on the
27th of February he died, leaving the command to
devolve on Barrington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March 6.<br />March 11.<br />March.</div>

<p>His death came none too soon, for the force was on
the brink of destruction. The number of the dead
cannot be ascertained, but over and above the six
hundred invalids sent to Antigua there were more than
sixteen hundred men on the sick list, and the remainder
were succumbing so fast that sufficient men could hardly
be found to do the daily duty. Barrington resolved to
close this fatal period of inaction at once. The defences
of the fort of Basseterre had already been repaired and
rendered safe against attack, so the Sixty-third regiment
was left to hold it while the remainder of the troops
were embarked on board the transports. After five
days of weary beating against the trade-wind a portion
of the ships came to anchor before Fort Louis; but
more than half of them had fallen to leeward. The
next day was spent by Barrington in an open boat
reconnoitring the coast, but on his return in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
he was met by the bad news that a French squadron had
been sighted to northward of Barbados and that Moore
felt bound to fall back with his own squadron to Prince
Rupert's Bay, Dominica, in order to cover Basseterre
and the British Leeward Islands. Finally, as sickness
had wrought little less havoc in the fleet than in the
army, the Commodore begged for troops to make up
the complement of his crews.</p>

<p>Few situations could have been more embarrassing
than that in which Barrington now found himself. He
loyally gave Moore three hundred soldiers for his ships,
and watched the fleet on which his communications
depended vanish from sight. Nearly if not quite half
of his force had perished or was unfit for duty; while
of the rest a part was isolated in Basseterre and fully
one moiety was at sea, striving to beat into Point à
Pitre. Fort Louis, the only strong position in which he
could hope to wait in safety, was found to be untenable;
and the French were already preparing to besiege it.
Yet with a resolution which stamps him as no common
man, he resolved despite all difficulties to begin offensive
operations at once. He had at any rate transports
though he had no men-of-war, and he resolved to use
them; his plan being, if he failed to bring the enemy
to action, to ravage the whole island and reduce it by
starvation. The cultivated land in such a confusion of
mountains could lie only in the valleys, and the settlements
must needs lie at the mouths of those valleys
where there was communication with other parts of the
island by sea or by roads that followed the coast. The
French had raised abundance of batteries and entrenchments
to protect these settlements, but such multiplicity
of defences necessarily implied dispersion of force.
Barrington's troops, few though they might be, were at
any rate to some extent concentrated; and it was in his
power to embark men sufficient to overwhelm any one
of these isolated settlements, and so to break up the
defences in detail. The operations were not in fact
difficult when once a man had thought out the method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of conducting them, but it was precisely in this matter
of thought that Hopson had failed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March 27.<br />March 29.</div>

<p>A fortnight was occupied in strengthening the
defences of Port Louis; and on the 27th of March
six hundred men were embarked under command of
Colonel Crump and sent off to the south coast of Grande
Terre, with orders to land between the towns of St.
Anne and St. François, destroy both of them and ruin
the batteries erected for their protection. Crump, an
excellent officer, performed this duty punctually and
with little loss; and on the 29th Barrington, guessing
that the French would certainly have detached some of
their troops from Gosier, a port a few miles to westward
of St. Anne, sailed with three hundred men against it,
and at dawn fell upon the enemy in their entrenchments.
The troops, eager for work after long inaction, attacked
with great spirit, drove the enemy out with little difficulty
and slight loss, and then prepared to force their
way back to Fort Louis by land. Barrington had
ordered two separate sallies to be made by the garrison
upon the lines erected by the French against the fort,
but owing to some mistake one only was delivered.
Nevertheless his own little detachment did the work unaided,
captured a battery of twenty-four pounders which
had been planted by the enemy to open on the fort on
the next day, and returned to its quarters triumphant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 12.<br />April 13.</div>

<p>By this time the missing transports had succeeded
in working into Point à Pitre; but to countervail this
advantage there came news from Basseterre that the
colonel in command, a valuable officer, had been killed,
together with one or two of his men, by an accidental
explosion, and that the French were constructing
batteries to bombard the fort. Barrington appointed a
new commander, with orders to sally forth and capture
these batteries without more ado; and the task, since he
had chosen the right men to execute it, was performed
with little trouble or loss. Moreover, having now
ruined the most important settlements in Grande Terre
he resolved to apply the same principles of warfare to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
Guadeloupe. Accordingly on the 12th of April Brigadier
Clavering, with thirteen hundred men and six guns,
was sent off to a bay close to Arnouville,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> where they
landed unopposed, the enemy retiring to a strong position
in rear of the river Licorne. This position was all-important
to the French since it covered Mahault Bay,
which was the port by which the Dutch supplied Guadeloupe
with provisions from the island of St. Eustatia. It
was so strong by nature that it needed little fortification
by art; access to the river being barred by a mangrove
swamp, across which there were but two narrow approaches,
both of them protected by redoubts, palisaded
entrenchments, and cannon. None the less Clavering
determined to attack. Covered by a heavy fire of
artillery the Fourth and Forty-second advanced against
the French left, firing by platoons as coolly as if on
parade, till the Highlanders drawing their claymores
made a rush, and the Fourth dashing forward with the
bayonet drove the French from the redoubt. Then
pushing round to the rear of the entrenchments on the
French right they forced the enemy to evacuate them
also, and captured seventy prisoners. The French then
retreated southward, setting fire to the cane-fields as
they passed in order to check the British pursuit, and
took post behind the river Lezarde, breaking down the
bridge behind them. It was too late for Clavering to
attack them on that day, for the only ford on the river
was protected by a redoubt and four guns; but keeping
up a fire of artillery all night in order to distract the
enemy's attention, he passed a party in a canoe across
the river below the position of the French, who no
sooner saw their right flank turned than they retired
with precipitation, abandoning all their guns. Following
the coast southward to Petit Bourg, where they had
prepared fortified lines and armed redoubts, the French
again tried to make a stand; but Barrington had sent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
bomb-vessel to await them off the coast, which opened
fire with shell and drove them back once more, before
they could withdraw their guns from the entrenchments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 14.<br />April 18.<br />April 19.<br />May 1.</div>

<p>Then and not till then did Clavering grant his men
a halt after their hard work under the tropical sun; but
on the 15th he was in motion again, and a detachment
of a hundred men was sent to capture the next battery
to southward at the town of Gouyave. The French,
now thoroughly disheartened, waited only to fire one
shot and then fled, leaving seven guns behind them,
when the British having spiked the cannon retired to
Petit Bourg. On the same day Colonel Crump was
sent with seven hundred men to Mahault Bay, where
he found the French defences abandoned. Having
destroyed them, together with a vast quantity of stores,
he marched to join Clavering at Petit Bourg and to
help in the work of desolating the country round it.
Heavy rain suspended operations during the two
following days; but on the 18th the entire force,
excepting a garrison of two hundred and fifty men
which was left at Petit Bourg, renewed the advance
southward upon St. Maries, where all the French troops
in the island were assembled to oppose it. The French
position was as usual strongly entrenched, but the paths
that led to rear of it, being judged impassable, were
left unguarded. A detachment was therefore sent to
turn the entrenchments by these paths, and the artillery
was hastened up to the front; but the guns had hardly
opened fire when the French, perceiving the movement
in their rear, deserted their fortifications and fled to
another entrenched position on the heights beyond St.
Maries. The British pursued; and, while the ground
was clearing for the artillery to come into action, part
of the infantry tried to force a way through the forest
and precipices on the flank of the earthworks. The
French, weary of finding position after position turned,
left their fortified lines to meet this attack, whereupon
Clavering instantly launched the remainder of his troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
straight at the lines, and despite a heavy fire of artillery
and musketry swept the enemy out of this last refuge.
On the morrow the army entered the district of Capesterre,
reputed the richest in the whole of the West
Indies; and the inhabitants, dreading lest it should be
overtaken by the fate of the rest, came and begged for
terms. A capitulation was therefore granted on liberal
conditions, and Guadeloupe, one of the wealthiest of
the Antilles, with a harbour large enough to shelter the
whole Navy of England from hurricanes, passed for the
present to the Crown of Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 26.</div>

<p>The surrender came in the nick of time, for the ink
of the signatures was hardly dry when news came of the
arrival of General Beauharnais from Martinique with
six hundred French regular troops and two thousand
buccaneers. A day earlier this reinforcement would
have saved Guadeloupe; but on hearing of the capitulation
Beauharnais re-embarked his troops and sailed
away. Nothing therefore remained for Barrington but
to settle the administration, fortify the harbour, and
leave a sufficient garrison to hold it. The island of
Mariegalante, which had not been included in the
capitulation, made some show of defiance but surrendered
on the first display of force. Crump was installed as
Governor; the Fourth, Sixty-third, and Sixty-fifth were
left with him; the Thirty-eighth returned to its old
quarters in the Leeward Islands, the Highlanders were
shipped off to America, and in June Barrington, with
the remnant of the Buffs, Sixty-first, and Sixty-fourth,
returned to England.</p>

<p>So ended the campaign of Guadeloupe. The story
is one which is little known, and the name of John
Barrington is one of which few have heard; yet surely
the achievements of himself and of his troops are such
as should not be forgotten. Barrington took over
from Hopson an army weakened by sickness, worn to
death by defensive warfare of the most harassing kind,
and disheartened by the consciousness that it was
working to no purpose. He at once shifted his base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
for more active operations, only to find, to his great
mortification, half of his force literally at sea, and the
fleet taken from him for other duty. Yet he went to
work at once; and knowing that he could not take the
island by force reduced it to submission by cutting off
and destroying its supplies. I have not hesitated to
describe the petty engagements which followed, since
there was not one which did not show forethought in
the planning and skill in the execution. It is true that
the French regular troops on the island were few, and
that the enemy which deserted its entrenchments so
readily was made up mainly of raw militia and armed
civilians; but they never fought except in a strong
position protected by artillery. It is true also that the
actual work in the field was done by Crump and
Clavering, two excellent officers, for Barrington was so
much crippled by gout that he could hardly leave Fort
Louis. Nevertheless the whole scheme of operations
was Barrington's, and no man more cordially acknowledged
the fact than Clavering himself. The number
of the British killed and wounded in action is unfortunately
not to be ascertained, but judging by the casualties
of the officers, of whom eleven were killed and twenty-one
wounded, it was not very great. But it is not lead
and steel that are most fatal in a tropical expedition,
and it is not in killed and wounded that its cost must
be reckoned. The island had been conquered, but the
climate had not; and the climate took its revenge. By
the close of the seven months that remained of the year
1759 nearly eight hundred officers and men of the
garrison had found their graves in Guadeloupe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758.<br />Dec. 1.</div>

<p class="noindent">It was late in November before Parliament reassembled,
and listened to a speech from the throne, jubilant over
the captures of Louisburg, Fort Frontenac, and Senegal,
but modestly deploring the inevitable expense of the
war. The Commons, however, were practically unanimous
in allowing a free hand to Pitt, though the
minister himself was startled when he was brought face
to face with the estimates. Those for the Army were
introduced a week later, and showed but a slight
increase in the British Establishment, the total number
of men not exceeding eighty-five thousand. Yet the
main operations of the coming year were to be conducted
on a grander scale than before, while at the
same time provision was needed to make good the
enormous waste caused by tropical expeditions. Two
new regiments only were formed before the actual
opening of the operations of 1759, one of them,
Colonel Eyre Coote's,<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> serving as a reminder that
concurrently with all other enterprises there was progressing
the struggle, which shall presently be narrated,
for the mastery of the East Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759.</div>

<p>Pitt's principal effort, as in the previous year, was
directed against Canada, and the operations prescribed
were little less complicated than those of the last
campaign. In the first place a direct attack was to be
made upon Quebec, for which purpose Amherst was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to make over ten battalions to General Wolfe. In
the second, the attempt to penetrate into Canada by
way of Ticonderoga and Crown Point was to be
renewed. Amherst himself was to take this duty upon
him, Abercromby having been rightly recalled; and
it was hoped that he might join Wolfe in the capital
of Canada or at least make a powerful diversion in his
favour. At the same time Amherst was ordered to
secure Oswego and Pittsburg, and empowered to
undertake any further operations that he pleased,
without prejudice to the main objects of the campaign.
The General having already twenty-three battalions
of the King's troops in America, it was reckoned that,
with the regiments to be forwarded to him from the
West Indies by Hopson, he would possess a sufficient
force for the work. No fresh battalions therefore
were sent to him from England.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>The selection of James Wolfe for the command
of the expedition against Quebec came as a surprise to
many. He was now thirty-two years of age, and had
held a commission ever since he was fourteen, attaining
the rank of captain at seventeen and of major at
twenty. He had served in Flanders and distinguished
himself as brigade-major at Lauffeld, but it was as
Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the Twentieth Foot
that he had shown himself most competent. He was
an admirable regimental officer, enthusiastic over his
profession and well acquainted with its duties, a stern
disciplinarian yet devoted to his men, and a refined and
educated gentleman. In short he was a commanding
officer who could be trusted to raise the tone of any
corps.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> He had attracted Pitt's notice by his constant
though fruitless advocacy of action in the abortive
descent on Rochefort in 1757, and had come
prominently before the public eye by his behaviour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>at Louisburg. His relations with Amherst, however,
appear not to have been very friendly, nor to have
been improved by his return home from Cape Breton
in 1758; indeed Wolfe was reprimanded as soon as
he arrived in England for returning without the King's
orders, under misconception of his letter of service.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
It was possibly under the sting of this censure that
he wrote to Pitt declaring his readiness to serve in
America and "particularly in the river St. Lawrence";
but be that as it may he received the appointment.
There is an anecdote that he filled the great minister
with dismay by some extraordinary gasconnade at a
dinner to which he had been invited shortly before his
departure; but even if, in a moment of elation,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> he
may have given way to excited talk for a time, yet
such outbursts were not usual with him, for he was the
quietest and most modest of men. The real objection to
his appointment was the state of his health. He had
never been strong and was a martyr to rheumatism
and stone, but he was as courageous against pain as
against the bullets of the enemy; in fact, like King
William the Third, he was never so happy as when
under fire. For the rest nature had cursed him with
a countenance of singular ugliness, his portraits showing
a profile that runs in a ridiculous curve from the
forehead to the tip of the nose, and recedes in as
ridiculous a curve from the nose to the neck. A
shock of red hair tied in a queue, and a tall, lank,
ungainly figure added neither grace nor beauty to his
appearance; but within that unhandsome frame lay
a passionate attachment to the British soldier, and an
indomitable spirit against difficulty and danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">February.<br />May.</div>

<p>It was the middle of February when Wolfe sailed
from England in H.M.S. <i>Neptune</i>, the flag-ship of
a fleet of twenty-one sail under Admirals Saunders,
Holmes, and Durell. The voyage was long and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>tedious, and when at last Louisburg was reached the
harbour was found to be blocked with ice, so that the
fleet was obliged to make for Halifax. From thence
Durell was detached, too late as was presently proved,
to the mouth of the St. Lawrence to intercept certain
transports that were expected with supplies from
France; Holmes was sent to convoy the troops that
were to sail from New York; and in May the entire
armament for the reduction of Quebec was assembled
at Louisburg. Wolfe had been led to expect a force
of twelve thousand men; but the regiments which
should have been detached from Guadeloupe could
not yet be spared, and those drawn from the garrisons
of Nova Scotia had been reduced considerably beneath
their proper strength by sickness during the winter.
The quality of the troops, however, was excellent, and
on this Wolfe counted to make good a serious numerical
deficiency. The force was distributed into three
brigades, under Brigadiers Monckton, Townsend, and
Murray, all three of them men of youth, energy, and
talent, well qualified to serve under such a commander
as Wolfe.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The grenadiers of the army were, as had
now become usual, massed together and organised in
two divisions, those of the regiments in garrison at
Louisburg being known as the Louisburg grenadiers.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
Another separate corps was composed of the best
marksmen in the several regiments, and was called the
Light Infantry, while six companies of Provincial
rangers furnished a proportion of irregular troops.
The whole strength of the force was thus brought
up to about eight thousand five hundred men. A
fortnight sufficed for the final arrangements, for
Amherst and his staff had spared no pains to provide
all that was necessary;<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and on the 6th of June the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>last division of transports, amid a roar of cheering from
the men, sailed out of Louisburg for the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The French commanders meanwhile had been
anxiously making their preparations for defence. There
could be no doubt that the British would make at least
a double attack upon Canada, from Lake Champlain on
the south and Lake Ontario on the west, and every
able-bodied man in the colony was called out to repel
it. No sooner had the dispositions been settled than
news came of the intended advance by the St. Lawrence,
which threw the whole colony into consternation.
Five regular battalions and the militia from every part
of Canada were summoned, together with a thousand
Indians, to Quebec; and after much debate Montcalm,
who held the command of the troops under the Governor
of the city, decided on his scheme of defence. Quebec
with its fortifications stands on the north bank of the
St. Lawrence, being situated on a rocky headland which
marks the contraction of the river from a width of
fifteen or twenty miles to a strait scarcely exceeding
one. Immediately to northward of this ridge the river
St. Charles flows down to the St. Lawrence; and seven
miles to eastward of the St. Charles the shore is cut by
the rocky gorge through which pours the cataract of
the Montmorenci. It was between these two streams
that Montcalm disposed his army, his right resting on
the St. Charles, his left on the Montmorenci, with his
headquarters on the little river of Beauport midway
between the two, and his front to the St. Lawrence.
All along the border of the great river were thrown up
entrenchments, batteries, and redoubts. From Montmorenci
to Beauport abrupt and rocky heights raised
these defences too high above the water to be reached
by the cannon of ships. From Beauport to the St.
Charles stretched broad flats of mud, which were commanded
by batteries both afloat and ashore, as well as
by the guns of Quebec. On the walls of the city itself
were mounted over one hundred cannon; a bridge of
boats with a strong bridge-head on the eastern side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
preserved the communication between city and camp;
and for the defence of the river itself there was a floating
battery of twelve heavy guns besides several gun-boats
and fire-ships. The vessels of the convoy that Durell
had failed to intercept, together with the frigates that
escorted them, were sent up the river beyond Quebec to
be out of harm's way; and the sailors were taken to man
the batteries ashore. Thus strongly entrenched with
fourteen thousand men of one description and another,
and firm in the belief that no foreign ship would dare
to attempt the intricate navigation of the St. Lawrence,
Montcalm waited for the British to come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>It was not until the 21st of June that the first mast-heads
of the fleet were seen. For days the British had
been groping their way up the river, helped partly by a
captured Canadian pilot, more often by their own skill
and experience. "Damn me if there are not a thousand
places in the Thames fifty times more hazardous than
this," growled an old skipper on one of the transports,
as he waived the pilot contemptuously aside. So the
great fleet crept up the stream, ships of the line passing
where the French had feared to take a coasting schooner,
and at last on the 26th of June the whole was anchored
safely off the southern shore of the Isle of Orleans, a few
miles below Quebec. No single mishap had marred
this masterly and superb feat of pilotage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 27.<br />June 28.<br />June 29.<br />July.</div>

<p>The troops landed without resistance next day on
the Isle of Orleans, and on the same afternoon a sudden
squall drove many of the ships ashore and destroyed
several of the flat-boats prepared for the disembarkation.
The storm raised high hopes of providential deliverance
in the French, which, however, were speedily dashed,
for the tempest subsided as suddenly as it had arisen.
On the morrow therefore the Governor of Quebec resolved
to launch his fire-ships down the river upon the
fleet. The attempt was duly made, but the ships were
ill-handled and the service ill-executed. The British
sailors coolly rowed out, grappled the burning vessels
and towed them ashore, while the troops, formed up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
order of battle, gazed at the most imposing display of
fireworks that they had ever seen. Meanwhile Wolfe
reconnoitred the French lines and the city, but could
see no possible opening for a successful attack. One
thing alone seemed feasible, to occupy the heights of
Point Lévis over against Quebec on the southern shore,
and to fire across this, the narrowest part of the river,
upon the city. Monckton's brigade accordingly entrenched
itself on these heights, threw up batteries, and
on the 12th of July opened a fire which wrought havoc
among the buildings of Quebec. But however this
cannonade might afflict the nerves of the inhabitants, it
could contribute little, as Wolfe well knew, to advance
the real work in hand.</p>

<p>Accordingly, while the batteries on Point Lévis were
constructing, the English General resolved to see whether
a vulnerable point could be found on Montcalm's left
flank. On the 8th of July, leaving a detachment to hold
the camp on the Isle of Orleans, he sent Townsend's and
Murray's brigades across to the northern bank of the
St. Lawrence, where they proceeded to entrench themselves
on the eastern side of the Montmorenci. The
movement was highly perilous, since it divided his
force into three portions, no one of which could support
the other; but the French kept themselves rigidly on
the defensive, though the British lay but a gunshot from
them across the rocky gorge of the Montmorenci and
annoyed their camp not a little with their artillery.
Still Wolfe could accomplish nothing decisive. The
news that Amherst was advancing against Ticonderoga
did indeed discourage the Canadians and increase
desertion among them; but in all other respects the
operations before Quebec had come to a deadlock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 18.<br />July 28.</div>

<p>Now, however, the fleet which had already vanquished
the difficulties in the navigation of the St. Lawrence
once more came forward to show the way. It was
the opinion of the French that no vessel could pass the
batteries of Quebec without destruction; but on the
night of the 18th of July H.M.S. <i>Sutherland</i>, of fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
guns, with several smaller vessels, sailed safely up the
river, covered by the fire of the guns on Point Lévis,
destroyed some small craft which they found there and
anchored above the town. This was the first menace
of an attempt to take Quebec in reverse, and obliged
Montcalm to detach six hundred men from the camp
of Beauport to defend the few accessible points between
the city and Cap Rouge, some eight miles above it.
Wolfe took advantage of the movement also to send
a detachment to ravage the country to westward of
Quebec; but though he thus added a fourth to the three
isolated divisions into which he had broken up his army,
Montcalm still declined to move. A second attempt
was indeed made to destroy the British vessels by fire-ships,
which was frustrated like the first by the coolness
and gallantry of the British sailors; but beyond this
French aggression would not go. Montcalm was resolved
to play the part of Fabius, and he seemed likely
to play it with success.</p>

<p>The season was now wearing on, and Wolfe was not
a whit nearer to his object than at his first disembarkation.
Mortified by his ill-success he now resolved to
attack Montcalm's camp in front. The hazard was
desperate, for, after leaving troops to hold Point Lévis
and the entrenchments on the Montmorenci, he could
raise little more than five thousand men with which to
attack a force of more than double his strength in a
very formidable position. A mile to westward of the
falls of the Montmorenci there is a strand about a
furlong wide at high water and half a mile wide at low
tide, between that river and the foot of the cliffs. The
French had built redoubts on this strand above high-water
mark, which were commanded, though Wolfe
could not see it, by the fire of musketry from the
entrenchments above. Wolfe's hope was that by the
capture of one of these redoubts he might tempt the
French down to regain it and so bring on a general
action, or at least find an opportunity of reconnoitring
the entrenched camp itself. Moreover, below the falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
of the Montmorenci was a ford, by which some at least
of his troops on that river could join in the attack,
and so diminish in some degree the disparity of
numbers. But Wolfe held the Canadian militia in such
contempt that he was not afraid to pit against them,
at whatever odds, the valour of his own disciplined
soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 31.</div>

<p>Accordingly on the morning of the 31st of July
H.M.S. <i>Centurion</i> stood in close to the Montmorenci,
dropped her anchor and opened fire on the redoubts.
Two armed transports followed her and likewise opened
fire on the nearest redoubt, stranding as the tide ebbed
till at last they lay high and dry on the mud. Simultaneously
the batteries on the other side of the Montmorenci
opened a furious fire upon the flank of Montcalm's
entrenchments, and at eleven o'clock a number
of boats filled with troops rowed across from Point
Lévis and hovered about the river opposite Beauport
as if to attack at that point. Time, however, showed
Montcalm where real danger was to be apprehended,
and he concentrated the whole of his twelve thousand
men between Beauport and the Montmorenci. At
half-past five the British batteries afloat and ashore
opened fire with redoubled fury, and the boats made a
dash for the shore. Unfortunately some of them
grounded on a ledge short of the flats, which caused
some confusion and delay, but eventually all of them
reached the strand and set the men ashore. Thirteen
companies of grenadiers were the first to land, and
after them two hundred men of the Sixtieth; while
some distance behind them the Fifteenth and Fraser's
Highlanders followed in support. No sooner were
they ashore than the grenadiers, the most trusted
troops in the army, for some reason got out of hand.
Despite the efforts of their officers they would not wait
for the supports to form up, but made a rush in the
greatest disorder and confusion for the redoubt and
drove the French from it. Instantly a tremendous fire
was poured upon them from the entrenchments above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
The grenadiers recoiled for a moment; then recovering
themselves they ran forward again and made a mad
effort to struggle up the steep, slippery grass of the
ascent, but only to roll down by scores, killed or
wounded by the hail of musketry from the French
lines. Where the affair would have ended it is hard to
say, had not the clouds of a summer's storm, which had
hung over the river all the afternoon, suddenly burst
just at that moment in a deluge of rain. All ammunition
on both sides was drenched, so that further firing
became impossible, while the grassy slope became so
treacherous that it was hopeless to attempt to climb it.
Wolfe, seeing that everything was gone wrong, ordered
a retreat; and the troops fell back and re-embarked, the
grenadiers and Sixtieth having lost five hundred officers
and men, or well-nigh half of their numbers, in killed,
wounded, and missing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August 5.</div>

<p>Wolfe was highly indignant over the misbehaviour
of the grenadiers, and rebuked them sharply in general
orders for their impetuous, irregular, and unsoldierlike
proceedings. The French, on the other hand, were
naturally much elated, and flattered themselves that the
campaign was virtually at an end. Nor was Wolfe of
a very different opinion. It is said, indeed, that he conceived
the idea of leaving a part of his troops in a
fortified position before Quebec, to be ready for a new
attempt in the following spring. Meanwhile for the
present he fell back on the tactics, which Barrington
had so successfully employed at Guadeloupe, of laying
waste all the settlements round about Quebec, with the
object of provoking desertion among the militia and
exhausting the colony generally. Montcalm, however,
was not to be enticed from his lines; he had Indians
with him sufficient to make hideous reprisals for Wolfe's
desolation, and Canada was not to be won by the
burning of villages. Wolfe, therefore, now shifted his
operations to the point whither the enterprise of the
fleet had led him, above and on the reverse side of
Quebec. With every fair wind more and more ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
had braved the fire of the batteries and passed through
it in safety; and now a flotilla of flat-boats dared the
same passage, while twelve hundred men under Brigadier
Murray marched overland up the south bank of the St.
Lawrence to do service in them. This movement compelled
Montcalm to withdraw another fifteen hundred
men from the camp at Beauport, to check any attempt
at a landing above the city. The duty thus imposed
upon this small body of French was most arduous, since
it involved anxious watching of fifteen or twenty miles
of the shore. So well was it performed, however, under
the direction of Bougainville, an officer afterwards
famous as the great navigator, that it was only after two
repulses that Murray succeeded in burning a large
magazine of French stores. The alarm caused by this
stroke was so great that Montcalm hastened from
Beauport to take command in person; but when he
arrived the British had already retired, content with
their success.</p>

<p>None the less the French from the highest to the
lowest now grew seriously uneasy. Their army was on
short rations. All its supplies were drawn from the
districts of Three Rivers and Montreal; and, from want
of transport overland, these were perforce sent down the
river where the British ships lay ready to intercept them.
Now was seen the error of sending the frigates up the
river and allowing the British squadron to assemble by
small detachments above Quebec; but it was too late
to repair it. The British fleet had discovered the true
method of reducing the city by severing its communications
both above and below. The only hope for the
French was that winter might drive the shipping from
the St. Lawrence and put an end to the campaign, before
Quebec should be starved out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 15.<br />July.<br />July 24.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Amherst's operations to south and west
began likewise to tell upon the situation. Taking
advantage of the latitude allowed to him by Pitt, he
determined to add the reduction of Niagara to the enterprises
prescribed to him. This duty he assigned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
Brigadier Prideaux with five thousand men;<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Brigadier
Stanwix was entrusted with the relief of Pittsburg; and
Amherst in person took charge of the grand advance
by Lakes George and Champlain. The operations of
Prideaux and Stanwix were to be conducted in combination;
for it was intended that while Prideaux was
engaged with Niagara, Stanwix should push a force
northward against the French posts on Lake Erie, and
thence on to Niagara itself, thus releasing Prideaux for
an advance to the St. Lawrence. Prideaux was the first
to take the field. His force having been assembled on
the Mohawk at Senectady, he moved up the stream, left
a strong garrison at Fort Stanwix to guard the Great
Carrying-place, and moved forward by Lake Oneida and
the river Onandaga to Oswego. There leaving nearly
half of his force under Colonel Haldimand to secure his
retreat, he embarked with the rest on the lake for
Niagara. The fort stood in the angle formed by the
river Niagara and Lake Ontario, and was garrisoned by
some six hundred men. Prideaux at once laid siege
in form, though the trenches were at first so unskilfully
laid out by the engineers as to require almost
total reconstruction. At last, however, the batteries
opened fire. Prideaux was unluckily killed almost
immediately by the premature explosion of a shell from
one of his own guns, but Sir William Johnson, who
had joined the force with a party of Indians, took command
in his place and pushed the siege with great
energy. The fort after two or three weeks of battering
was in extremity; when a party of thirteen hundred
French rangers and Indians, which had been summoned
from the work of harassing the British on the Ohio to
the relief of Niagara, appeared on the scene in the very
nick of time. Johnson rose worthily to the occasion.
Leaving a third of his force in the trenches and yet
another third to guard his boats, he sallied forth with
the remainder to meet the relieving force, and after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
brisk engagement routed it completely. The survivors
fled hurriedly back to Lake Erie, burned Venango and
the posts on the lake and retired to Detroit. Niagara
surrendered on the evening of the same day, and thus
were accomplished at a stroke the most important
objects to be gained by Stanwix and Prideaux. The
whole region of the Upper Ohio was left in undisputed
possession of the British, and the French posts of the
West were hopelessly cut off from Canada. Now,
therefore, the ground was open for an advance on
Montreal by Lake Ontario; and Amherst lost no time
in sending General Gage to take command of Prideaux's
force, with orders to attack the French post of La
Galette, at the head of the rapids of the St. Lawrence,
and thence to push on as close as possible to Montreal.
"Now is the time," wrote Amherst to him, "and we
must make use of it."<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">July 21.<br />July 26.<br />August.</div>

<p>Amherst himself had assembled his army at the end
of June at the usual rendezvous by the head of Lake
George. His force consisted of about eleven thousand
five hundred men, five thousand of them Provincials and
the remainder British.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> As was now the rule, he had
massed the grenadiers of the army into one corps, and
had formed also a body of Light Infantry which he
had equipped appropriately for its work.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> It was not,
however, until the 21st of July that the troops were
embarked, and that a flotilla little less imposing than
Abercromby's set sail with a fair wind over Lake George.
It was drawn up in four columns, the light troops and
Provincials on either flank, the regular troops in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>right centre and the artillery and baggage in the left
centre. An advanced and a rear-guard in line covered
the head and tail of the columns, and an armed sloop
followed in rear of all. Before dark they had reached
the Narrows, and at daybreak of the following morning
the force disembarked and marched, meeting with little
resistance, by the route of Abercromby's second advance
to Ticonderoga. The entrenchments which had foiled
the British in the previous year had been reconstructed
but were found to be deserted; Bourlamaque, the French
commander, having withdrawn his garrison, some thirty-five
hundred men only, into the fort. Amherst brought
up his artillery to lay siege in form, but on the night of
the 26th a loud explosion announced that the French had
abandoned Ticonderoga and blown up the works. It
was, however, but one bastion that had been destroyed,
so Amherst at once repaired the damage and made
preparations for advance on Crown Point. On the 1st
of August he learned that Bourlamaque had abandoned
this fortress also, and fallen back to the strong position
of Isle aux Noix at the northern outlet of Lake Champlain.
Amherst was now brought to a standstill, for
the French had four armed vessels on the lake, and it
was necessary for him to build vessels likewise for the
protection of the flotilla before he could advance farther.
He at once set about this work, concurrently with
the erection of a strong fort at Crown Point, but
unfortunately he began too late. Amherst was above
all a methodical man, whose principle was to make good
each step gained before he attempted to move again.
Possibly he had not anticipated so easy an advance to
Crown Point, but, be that as it may, he had made no
provision for advancing beyond it, and when at last, by
the middle of September, his ships were ready, the
season was too far advanced for further operations. He
tried to stir up Gage to hasten to the attack on La
Galette, but without success. In fact by the middle of
August the campaign of the armies of the south and
west was virtually closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">August.</div>

<p>Nevertheless for the moment the news of Amherst's
advance to Crown Point caused great alarm in Quebec,
and Montcalm felt himself obliged to send Lévis, one
of his best officers, to superintend the defence of Montreal.
Gradually, however, as Amherst's inaction was prolonged,
the garrison regained confidence; and meanwhile deep
discouragement fell on the British. On the 20th of
August Wolfe, who was much exhausted by hard work,
anxiety, and mortification, fell seriously ill and was compelled
to delegate the conduct of operations to a council
of his brigadiers. Several plans were propounded to
them, all of which they rejected in favour of an attempt
to gain a footing on the ridge above the city, cut off
Montcalm's supplies from Montreal, and compel him to
fight or surrender. The course was that which had been
marked out by the fleet from the moment that the ships
had passed above Quebec. It was indeed both difficult
and hazardous, but it was the only plan that promised
any hope of success; and the success, if attained, would
be final. Wolfe accepted it forthwith and without
demur. The army had lost over eight hundred men
killed and wounded since the beginning of operations,
and had been weakened still more seriously by disease;
but the General was driven to desperation by sickness
and disappointment and was ready to undertake any
enterprise that commended itself to his officers. On the
last day of August he was sufficiently recovered to go
abroad once more, and on the 2nd of September he
wrote to Pitt the story of his failure up to that day
and of his resolutions for the future, all in a strain of
dejection that sank almost to despair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 3.</div>

<p>On the following day the troops were skilfully withdrawn
without loss from the camp on the Montmorenci.
On the night of the 4th a flotilla of flat-boats passed
successfully above the town with the baggage and stores,
and on the 5th seven battalions marched westward overland
from Point Lévis and embarked, together with
Wolfe himself, on Admiral Holmes' ships. Montcalm
thereupon reinforced Bougainville to a strength of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
thousand men and charged him to watch the movements
of the fleet with the utmost vigilance. Bougainville's
headquarters were at Cap Rouge, with detached fortified
posts at Sillery, six miles down the river, at Samos
yet farther down, and at Anse du Foulon, now called
Wolfe's Cove, a mile and a half above Quebec. It was
by this last that Wolfe, searching the heights for mile
after mile with his telescope, perceived a narrow path
running up the face of the precipice. From the path
he turned his glass to the post above it, and seeing but
ten or twelve tents concluded that the guard was not
numerous and might be overpowered. There then was
a way found for the ascent of the cliffs from the river:
the next problem was how to turn the discovery to good
account.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th of September Holmes'
squadron weighed anchor and sailed up to Cap Rouge.
The French instantly turned out to man their entrenchments;
and Wolfe, having kept them in suspense for a
sufficient time, ordered the troops into the boats and
directed them to row up and down as if in search of a
landing-place. The succeeding days were employed in
a series of similar feints, the ships drifting daily up to
Cap Rouge with the flood tide and dropping down to
Quebec with the ebb, till Bougainville, who followed
every movement with increasing anxiety and bewilderment,
fairly wore out his troops with incessant marching
to and fro.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 12.</div>

<p>At last on the 12th of September Wolfe's opportunity
presented itself. Two deserters came in from
Bougainville's camp with intelligence that at next ebb-tide
a convoy of provisions would pass down the river
to Quebec. Wolfe sent orders to Colonel Burton, who
was in command of the standing camps, that all the men
which he could spare from them should march at nightfall
along the southern bank of the river, and wait at a
chosen place for embarkation. As night fell Admiral
Saunders moved out of the basin of Orleans with the
main fleet and ranged the ships along the length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
camp at Beauport. The boats were then lowered and
manned by marines, sailors, and such few soldiers as had
been left below Quebec, while the ships opened fire on
the beach as if to clear it for a landing. Montcalm,
completely deceived, massed the whole of his troops at
Beauport, and kept them under arms to repel the
threatened attack. Meanwhile Holmes' squadron, with
boats moored alongside the transports, lay quietly
anchored off Cap Rouge, nor showed sign of life until
late dusk, when seventeen hundred men<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> took their
places in the boats and drifted with the tide for some
little distance up the stream. Bougainville marked the
movement and made no doubt that attack was designed
upon his headquarters. Night fell, dark and moonless,
and all was quiet. Monsieur Vergor, who commanded
the post at Anse du Foulon, gave leave to most of his
guard of Canadians to go harvesting, and saw no reason
why he should not himself go comfortably to bed.
Bougainville remained on the alert, doubtless impatient
for the tide to turn, which would carry the British away
from his quarters and leave him in peace. He did
not know that Wolfe was even then on board the flag-ship
making his final arrangements for the morrow's
battle, and that he had handed the portrait of his betrothed
to Captain John Jervis<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> of H.M.S. <i>Porcupine</i>,
to be returned to her in the event of his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 13.</div>

<p>At length at two o'clock in the morning the tide
ebbed. Two lanterns rose flickering to the maintop
shrouds of the <i>Sutherland</i>; Wolfe and his officers
stepped into their boat, and with the whole flotilla astern
of them dropped silently down the river. After a due
interval the sloops and frigates followed, with the second
division of troops on board;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and Bougainville with a
sigh of relief resolved not to harass his men by a fruitless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>march after them. For full two hours the boats
pursued their way, when the silence was broken by the
challenge of a French sentry. "France," answered a
Highland officer who had learned the French tongue
on foreign service. "What regiment?" pursued the
sentry. "The Queen's" (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la Reine</i>) replied the
officer, naming a corps that formed part of Bougainville's
force. The sentry, knowing that a convoy of provisions
was expected, allowed the boats to pass; for though
Bougainville had, as a matter of fact, countermanded
the convoy, the guards had not been apprised of the
countermand. Off Samos another sentry, visible not a
pistol-shot away from the boats, again challenged.
"Provision-boats," answered the same officer, "don't
make a noise or the English will hear." Once more
the boats were suffered to pass. Presently they rounded
the headland of Anse du Foulon, and there no sentry
was to be seen. The leading boats were carried by the
current somewhat below the intended landing-place, and
the troops disembarked below the path, on a narrow
strand at the foot of the heights. Then twenty-four
men of the Light Infantry, who had volunteered for a
certain unknown but dangerous service under Colonel
Howe, slung their muskets about them, threw themselves
upon the face of the cliff, and began to drag themselves
through the two hundred feet of stunted bush that
separated them from the enemy.</p>

<p>The dawn was just breaking as they reached the top,
and through the dim light they could distinguish the
group of tents that composed Vergor's encampment.
Instantly they dashed at them; and the French, utterly
surprised, at once took to their heels. Vergor, who
was reputed a coward, stood firm and fired his pistols;
and the report of three of the British muskets, together
with the cheers of Howe's forlorn hope, gave Wolfe
the signal for which he waited. He uttered the word
to advance, and the rest of the troops swarmed up the
cliff to their comrades as best they could. The zigzag
path which had first attracted Wolfe's eye was found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
be obstructed by trenches and abatis, but these obstacles
were cleared away and the ascent made easier. Presently
the report of cannon was heard from up the river: the
batteries of Sillery and Samos were firing at the rearmost
of the boats and at Holmes' squadron. Howe and his
Light Infantry were detached to silence them, which they
effectually did; and meanwhile the disembarkation proceeded
rapidly. As fast as the boats were emptied they
went back to fetch the second division from the ships
and Burton's men from the opposite shore. Before the
sun was well up the whole force of forty-five hundred
men had accomplished the ascent, and was filing across
the plain at the summit of the heights.</p>

<p>Wolfe went forward to reconnoitre. The ground
on which he stood formed part of the high plateau
which ends in the promontory of Quebec. About a
mile to eastward of the landing-place was a tract of
grass, known as the plains of Abraham, fairly level
ground for the most part, though broken by patches of
corn and clumps of bushes, and bounded on the south
by the heights of the St. Lawrence and to north by
those of the St. Charles. On these plains, where the
plateau is less than a mile wide, Wolfe chose his position
for the expected battle. His situation, despite the skilful
execution of the movement which brought his army
across Montcalm's line of communication, was no secure
nor enviable one, for besides Montcalm's army and the
garrison of Quebec in his front, he had also to reckon
with Bougainville's detachment in his rear. His only
chance of success was that the French should allow him
to beat them in detail, that, in fact, they should bring
out their main army and give him opportunity to crush
it in front, before Bougainville should have time to
operate effectively in his rear. But there was no reason
why the French should do anything of the kind; and
Wolfe's dispositions needed to be regulated accordingly.
The extent of the ground was too great to permit order
of battle in more than one line; and it was in one line
that he prepared to meet the main force from the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
of Quebec. The right wing rested on the brink of the
heights above the St. Lawrence, and here was stationed
a single platoon of the Twenty-eighth. Next it, in succession
from right to left, stood the Thirty-fifth, three
companies of the Louisburg grenadiers,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> the remainder
of the Twenty-eighth, the Forty-third, Forty-seventh,
Fraser's Highlanders, and the Fifty-eighth. Straight
through the centre of the position, midway between the
Forty-seventh and Fraser's, ran the road from Sillery to
Quebec, and here was posted a single light field-gun<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
which had been dragged up from Wolfe's Cove. On
the extreme left, beyond the flank of the Fifty-eighth,
ran the road from Sainte Foy to Quebec, with a few
scattered houses on the south side and patches of bushes
and coppice beyond it. The line, being three ranks
deep, was not long enough to rest its left on this road,
much less on the heights above the St. Charles, so the
Fifteenth foot was thrown back <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en potence</i> to prevent
the turning of the left flank. The second battalion of
the Sixtieth and the Forty-eighth Foot were stationed
in rear, the one on the left and the other on the right,
in eight subdivisions, with wide intervals. Two
companies of the Fifty-eighth were left to guard the
landing-place, the third battalion of the Sixtieth was
detached to the right rear to preserve communication
with it; and finally Howe's Light Infantry occupied a
wood far in rear, evidently to hold Bougainville in check.
Monckton commanded the right and Murray the left
of the fighting line, while Townsend took charge of the
scattered troops which did duty for a reserve. Wolfe
in person remained with Monckton's brigade.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> Probably
he anticipated that Montcalm would attempt to turn
his right and so cut off his retreat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Montcalm had passed a troubled night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>The false attack of the fleet on Beauport had kept
him in continual anxiety; and he was still more disquieted
at daybreak to hear the sound of the cannon
of Samos and Sillery above the city. He sent an
officer to the Governor's quarters in Quebec for information,
but received no answer; so at six o'clock
he rode up to look for himself, when on reaching the
right of his camp he caught sight, over the St. Charles,
of an ominous band of scarlet stretched across the
heights two miles away. His countenance fell. "This
is a serious business," he said, and he despatched an
aide-de-camp at full gallop to bring up the troops from
the right and centre of the camp of Beauport. The
men, only lately relieved from the manning of the
entrenchments, got under arms and streamed away in
hot haste across the bridge of the St. Charles and
through the narrow streets of the city&mdash;Indians,
Canadians, and regulars all alike stirred by the sudden
approach of danger. Further reconnaissance filled
Montcalm with still greater dismay. It was not a
mere detachment, but practically the entire British
army that had found its way to the heights between him
and Montreal. Meanwhile Vaudreuil, the Governor
of Quebec, who was also Commander-in-Chief, was not
to be found; and there was unity neither of direction
nor of obedience. Montcalm applied to Ramesay, who
commanded the garrison of Quebec, for twenty-five
field-guns which were mounted in one of the batteries:
Ramesay declared that he needed them for his own
defence and would spare but three. Then there was
anxious waiting for the troops from the left of
Beauport's camp, which for some reason never came.
All was confusion, perplexity, and distraction.</p>

<p>In such circumstances Montcalm appears to have
succumbed to nervous strain and to have lost his wits.
He held a hasty council of war with his principal
officers and decided to fight at once. He was afraid,
it seems, lest Wolfe should be reinforced or lest he
might entrench himself. Yet there was no occasion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
extreme haste. Another two hours would have sufficed,
if not to bring up the missing troops from Beauport,
at all events to procure more guns and to send a
messenger by a safe route to concert measures with
Bougainville; and the day was yet young. The
supplies of the French were failing, it is true, but their
army was not starving; and from whence was Wolfe
himself, with Bougainville in his rear, to draw his
supplies even supposing that he did entrench himself?
The British had two days' provisions with them, but
for all further supply they must depend on a single
zigzag path wide enough for but one man abreast.
Even supposing that Montcalm could not succeed in
obtaining the thirty field-guns for which he asked, and
which if obtained would almost inevitably have blasted
the British army off the field, there was nothing to
prevent him from manœuvring with a superior force
to keep the British under arms until nightfall, while
his Indians and irregulars, of whom he had abundance,
harried the British right flank in front and rear
under shelter of the scrub, and hindered the bringing
up of further stores. What would have been the
condition of Wolfe's army on the following morning
after a second night under arms, and what opening
might there not have been for successful attack?
But it was not to be. Whether Montcalm was spurred
on by the impatience of his own half-distracted force,
or whether he simply gave way to nervous exhaustion,
must remain uncertain. At any rate he resolved with
the five thousand troops that were with him to accept
battle at once.</p>

<p>By nine o'clock his line of battle was formed, some
six hundred yards from the British position. On his
right, resting on the road to Sainte Foy was a battalion
of Canadian militia, and next to it in succession the
regular regiments of Bèarn and La Sarre. Next to
these, in column on either side of the road to Sillery,
were the regiments of Guienne and Languedoc, and to
their left regiment Roussillon and another battalion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
militia. On the extreme right and left some two
thousand Indians and Canadians swarmed forward in
skirmishing order in advance of the line of battle. It
was with the fire of these sharpshooters that the action
began. There was good cover for them not only on
the flanks but also among the scattered bushes in the
front. Wolfe threw out skirmishers to meet them,
and the fusillade became lively, especially on the
British left, where Townsend's men began to fall fast.
So severe became this pressure on the left that
Townsend, alarmed for his flank, brought up the
second battalion of the Sixtieth to the left of the
Fifty-eighth, detailed part of them to drive the
Canadians from the houses by the road and doubled the
remainder back <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en potence</i> in line with the Fifteenth;
while at the same time the Light Infantry was called up
in support of the Fifteenth to strengthen the flank still
further. Thus before the action was well begun the
rear-guard and half of the reserve was practically
absorbed in the fighting line. On the British right,
where the French sharpshooters could not get round the
flank, their fire was by no means so deadly; but it does
not appear that either of these attacks formed part of
any settled plan of Montcalm, for by throwing the mass
of his skirmishers against the British left he might have
made them very formidable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Montcalm's three field-guns had opened
fire, and were answered by the single gun on the Sillery
road with great effect. So the minutes dragged on,
until at a little before ten the French line advanced
with loud shouts to the true attack, the regulars in the
centre moving steadily, a long streak of white edged
on either hand with red and with blue, and the militia
striving to move as steadily on the flanks. The
English, who until now had been lying down, then
sprang to their feet and stood steady with recovered
arms. At a range of two hundred yards the French
muskets opened fire but with little effect, while much
confusion and delay was caused by the Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
militia who, true to their instincts as skirmishers,
threw themselves flat on the ground to reload. Wolfe
was shot through the wrist, but he merely wrapped
his handkerchief round the wound, and called to the
men to be steady and reserve their fire. The French
recovered their order somewhat and again came on,
filling the air with their cries, while the British stood
calm, silent and immovable, knowing their chief and
trusting him.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> Nearer and nearer drew the parti-coloured
line, gayer and gayer as the blue and scarlet
facings on the white coats came into view, brighter
and brighter as the detail of metal buttons and
accoutrements cleared themselves from the distance, till
at length the time was come. Thirty-five yards only
separated the opposing arrays, when the word rang
out, the still red line sprang into life, the recovered
muskets leaped forward into a long bristling bar, and
with one deafening crash, the most perfect volley ever
fired on battlefield burst forth as if from a single
monstrous weapon, from end to end of the British
line. A dense bank of smoke blotted the French from
sight, and from behind it there rose a horrible din of
clattering arms, and savage oaths and agonised cries.
The sharp clink of ramrods broke in upon the sound
as the British reloaded; and when the smoke rolled
away, the gay line was seen to be shivered to fragments,
while the bright coats strewed the ground like swathes
of gaudy flowers. There was hardly a bullet of that
volley that had not struck home.</p>

<p>Montcalm, himself unhurt and conspicuous on a
black charger, galloped frantically up and down his
shattered ranks in a vain effort to restore order. Wolfe
gave the order to advance, and after one more volley
the scarlet line strode forward with bayonet and claymore
to complete the rout. There was nothing to stop
the British, nothing even to gall them except the fire of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
a few sharpshooters hidden in the scrub. Wolfe himself
led them at the head of the Twenty-eighth. A bullet
struck him in the groin, but he paused not a moment
and was still striding on, when another ball passed
through his lungs. He staggered forward, still vainly
striving to keep on his feet. "Support me, support
me," he gasped to an officer who was close to him,
"lest my gallant fellows should see me fall." Two or
three men fell out and carried him to the rear, but his
fall was noticed by few; and the victorious line pressed
on. Some of the sharpshooters continued to fire from
behind the shrubs and required to be driven out.
Others taking cover nearer to the town opened a biting
fire on the Highlanders who, charging as usual with
the claymore only, suffered much loss in the attempt to
force so wily an enemy from the bush. But other
regiments came up and did the work for them with the
musket, and thenceforward no further stand was made
by the French, but Montcalm's whole force broke up
and fled in wild confusion towards the town. He
himself, borne away in the rush of the fugitives, was
shot through the body, but being supported in the
saddle rode in through the gates. "It is nothing,
nothing," he called to the shrieking women who saw
the red stains on his white uniform; "don't distress
yourselves over me, good people." He was lifted from
his horse and borne into a surgeon's house to die. The
panic among the French increased. Their chief was
dying, his second mortally wounded; and among the
terrified mob that fled by the St. Charles there rose a
cry to destroy the bridge of boats, lest the English should
break into the camp of Beauport. This insane movement,
which would have sacrificed the whole of the
fugitives who had not yet crossed the river, was checked
by one or two officers who still kept their wits about
them; but none the less the French were not only
beaten but demoralised, and the victory of the British
was complete.</p>

<p>But the victors also had lost the services both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
their General and his second. Monckton had been
severely wounded by a musket-shot which for the
present disabled him from duty, and Wolfe had been
carried to the rear more dead than alive. He begged
his bearers to set him down, and refused to see a surgeon.
"There is no need," he said, "it is all over with me";
and he sank into unconsciousness. "How they run,"
cried out one of the attendants, as he watched the
French flying before the red-coats. "Who run?"
asked Wolfe, waking suddenly to life. "The enemy,
Sir, they give way everywhere." "Go one of you to
Colonel Burton," ordered the dying General with great
earnestness, "and tell him to march Webb's regiment<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
down to Charles River to cut off the retreat from the
bridge." He ceased, and turned on his side. "Now,
God be praised, I will die in peace," he murmured;
and so died.</p>

<p>With his death and the disabling of Monckton the
command devolved upon Townsend, who had no sooner
assumed it than he found the rear of the army threatened
by Bougainville. Turning upon this new enemy with
two battalions and two field-guns he soon forced him
to retire; and then, the pursuit being ended, he proceeded
to entrench himself on the battlefield. The
losses of the British were trifling compared with the
magnitude of the success, amounting to no more than
six hundred and thirty of all ranks killed and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
The chief sufferers were the Highlanders, during their
onslaught with the claymore, and the Fifteenth, Fifty-eighth
and second battalion of the Sixtieth, who bore
the brunt of the sharpshooting on the left flank. Before
midnight the entrenchments had made good progress,
and cannon had been brought up to defend them. A
battery also had been mounted at the northern angle of
the town, and the French hospital, full of sick and
wounded men, had been taken. Nothing is said of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>exhaustion of the troops, who had been on duty continuously
for at least thirty hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile utter confusion reigned in the French
camp. Vaudreuil called a council of war, and there
was tumultuous debate. A messenger was sent to the
dying Montcalm for advice, and returned with the
reply that there were three courses open, to retreat up
the river, to fight again, or to surrender the colony.
There was much to be said for fighting, for with
Bougainville's force the French could still bring superior
numbers into the field; still more to be said for the
defence of Quebec; but the demoralisation was too
deep to permit any bold action. At nine o'clock in
the evening Vaudreuil gave the order to retreat, and,
the word once uttered, the entire French force streamed
away in disorderly and disgraceful flight to the post
of Jacques Cartier, thirty miles up the St. Lawrence.
The only instructions left with the garrison of Quebec
were to surrender as soon as provisions should fail.
Well was it for Montcalm, always a brave and faithful
soldier, that his deliverance came to him before the
dawn of another day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 17.</div>

<p>Townsend for his part pushed his trenches forward
against Quebec with the greatest energy. The French,
despite their precipitate retreat, were still superior
force in his rear; and though certainly demoralised
might rally on joining the unbeaten troops of Lévis,
and imbibe new courage under the leadership of that
excellent officer. It was therefore imperative to press
the garrison hard while still overpowered by the
despairing sense of its isolation. On the 17th of
September the British ships of war moved up against
the Lower Town, and a scarlet column approached the
walls from the meadows of the St. Charles. The
French drums beat to arms, but the Canadian militia
refused to turn out, and the white flag was hoisted.
An officer was sent to Townsend's quarters to gain
time, if possible, by prolonging negotiations. Townsend's
answer was peremptory: unless the town were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
surrendered by eleven o'clock, he would take it by
storm; and on this Ramesay signed the capitulation.
It was none too soon. Before the messenger with the
signed articles had reached Townsend, Canadian horsemen
arrived with provisions and with a cheering message
that help was at hand; and on the very next morning
Lévis marched out from Jacques Cartier, only to learn
that he was just too late.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 18.</div>

<p>On the afternoon of the 18th the British entered the
city, and during the following weeks were employed in
strengthening the defences and making provision against
the winter; for it had been decided that the fortress
must be held at all risks. Monckton was still too far
disabled to assume command; Townsend, fresh from
the House of Commons, had no mind for such dreary
duty as winter-quarters; so Brigadier Murray was left as
Governor with a garrison of seven thousand five hundred
men, his battalions being strengthened by drafts from
the Sixty-second and Sixty-ninth, which were serving
on board the fleet. At the end of October Admiral
Saunders fired his farewell salute and dropped down the
river with his fleet, carrying with him the embalmed
remains of Wolfe, to be laid by his father's body in the
parish church of Greenwich.</p>

<p>So ended the first stage of the conquest of Canada,
with better fortune than might have been expected; for
there is no gainsaying the fact that the concert of operations
intended by Pitt and designed by Amherst had
broken down. It should seem indeed that the scheme
was too complex, that too much was attempted with
the resources at command, that the combination of
the various enterprises was too intricate to admit of
complete success in a wild and distant country, where
the campaigning season was so strictly bounded by the
climate. Amherst's operations depended greatly on the
help given to him by the Provincials, and the colonial
assemblies whatever their good-will were always dilatory,
while sometimes, as in the case of Pennsylvania, they
were intolerably recalcitrant. Again, though drafts had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
been sent to the General to make good the losses of the
previous campaign,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> these were not nearly sufficient to
fill the gaps made by the slaughter of Ticonderoga
and the bitter cold of a Canadian winter. Significantly
enough, also, no care had been taken to provide the
garrison of Louisburg, most arctic of quarters, even
with coverlets, so that the casualties in the winter were
far greater than they should have been.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Again, it had
been ordained that Hopson should reinforce Amherst
when his work at Martinique was done, but this arrangement
also had broken down; and the least forethought
as to the waste of a tropical campaign would have
shown that it should not have been reckoned on. The
result was that Amherst and Wolfe found themselves
with insufficient troops, and that as a natural consequence
the former was obliged to cut the margin of
his several operations too fine. The death of Prideaux,
an excellent officer, was a great misfortune, though
Johnson finished his work at Niagara efficiently enough.
Stanwix also, after overcoming vast difficulties of
transport, succeeded in penetrating to Pittsburg; but
here the operations of both columns came to an end.
The Ohio happened to be so low that Stanwix could
not send up a battalion, as he had been bidden, to
reinforce Gage for his advance to La Galette; and
Gage, who was not a very enterprising man, to
Amherst's great disappointment thought himself not
strong enough to move in consequence. On Amherst's
own failure to reach Montreal comment has already
been passed; but it should be remembered that the
whole burden of the preparations for Wolfe's expedition
was laid upon him, and that Wolfe gratefully
acknowledged the thoroughness of the work. Still the
fact remains that the diversions from south and west
were an almost total failure, and that Wolfe was consequently
obliged to perform his difficult task unaided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortune was against the British in that the weather
delayed the assembling of Wolfe's army at Louisburg;
for those few lost weeks might easily have made the
entire difference to the campaign. Wolfe, with an
inadequate force, was driven to his wits' end to solve
the problem assigned to him; and it is quite incontestable
that the credit for the fall of Quebec belongs rather
to the Navy than to the Army. The names of Saunders
and of Holmes are little remembered; and the fame of
James Cook the master, whose skill and diligence did
much to reveal the unknown channel of the St.
Lawrence, is swallowed up in that of Captain James
Cook the navigator. Still the fact remains unaltered.
It was the audacity of Holmes and his squadron in
running the gauntlet of the batteries of Quebec which
first threatened the supplies and communications of the
city, and forced Montcalm to weaken his main army by
detaching Bougainville. It was the terrible restless
energy of the same squadron, ever moving up and
down the river, which wore out the limbs of the French
soldiers and the nerves of their officers; and to the
Navy fully as much as to the Army is due the praise
for the movement that finally set Wolfe and his
battalions on the heights of Abraham. But in truth
this last most delicate and critical operation was so
admirably thought out and executed by the officers of
both services that it must abide for ever a masterpiece
in its kind. The British Navy and Army working,
as at Quebec, in concord and harmony under loyal and
able chiefs, are indeed not easily baffled.</p>

<p>It still remains for enquiry why Wolfe did not take
earlier advantage of the opportunities opened to him by
the fleet; and even after allowance has been made for
his constant illness, the answer is not readily found.
The measures which led to the decisive action were, as
has been told, taken on the advice of his brigadiers, and,
if Montcalm had not succumbed to positive infatuation,
would very likely have brought Wolfe to a court-martial.
But if instead of wasting the whole of August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
in futile efforts below Quebec, Wolfe had shifted his
operations forthwith to the west of the city, it seems at
least probable that he could have attained his object
without hazarding that desperate cast on the plains of
Abraham. It would presumably have been open to
him to gain the heights as he gained them ultimately,
to have overwhelmed Bougainville's posts piecemeal, as
was done as far as Sillery by a small detachment on the
morning of the battle, and to have entrenched himself
in the most suitable of them. Then having cut the
French communications by land and water, he could
have forced Montcalm either to abandon Quebec or to
fight on his own terms. But it is easy to be wise after
the event; and a brilliant success, however fortunate, is
rightly held to cover all errors. Moreover, the praise
for the perfection of drill and discipline which won the
victory with a single volley is all Wolfe's own. Still it
seems to be a fair criticism that the General was slow to
perceive the real weakness of Montcalm's position and
the vital spot laid open to him by the fleet for a deadly
thrust. The consequence was that the work was but
half done and, as shall now be seen, only narrowly
escaped undoing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759.</div>

<p class="noindent">The city of Quebec when the British entered into
possession was little better than a shapeless mass of ruins,
having been reduced to that state by the guns of the
fleet. The population was thoroughly demoralised, and
given over to theft and pillage; liquor was abundant
and the British soldier was thirsty; in fact it needed all
Murray's firmness to restore any kind of order.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> In
December severe weather began in earnest, and the
effects of bad quarters, bad food, insufficient clothing
and insufficient fuel speedily made themselves felt. The
sentries were relieved every hour, yet it was impossible
to keep them free of frost-bite. The Highlanders
despite their natural hardihood suffered more than their
comrades, the kilt being but a sorry protection against
a Canadian winter; and they were only relieved by a
supply of long woollen hose knitted for them, perhaps
as much for decency's as for charity's sake, by the nuns
of the city. Still the men remained cheerful, for they
were kept constantly at work cutting fuel and dragging
it in sledges to their quarters, an errand on which they
set forth always with muskets as well as with axes, from
fear of Indians and bushrangers. Nevertheless their
sufferings were great. Fifty men were frost-bitten on
a single day while employed on this duty; three days
later sixty-five more were similarly afflicted, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Christmas there were over a hundred and fifty cases.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
This, however, would have been a small matter but for
the more deadly scourge that was added to it. The
garrison was victualled entirely with salt provisions; it
was impossible to procure fresh meat for the men; and
scurvy grew and increased until there was hardly a
soldier in the ranks, even among those reckoned fit for
duty, who was wholly free from the disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760.</div>

<p>With such a plague in his midst Murray might well
feel apprehensive for the safety of Quebec against the
enemy without the walls, for ever since the British
occupation of the city the French had made no secret of
their intention to recapture it. Murray had established
two fortified posts a few miles to westward of Quebec
at Sainte Foy and Old Lorette; while the French had
established themselves at St. Augustine, only two days'
march from the gates, from which position it was soon
necessary to expel them. Petty skirmishes such as this
were frequent, but ended always with so easy advantage
to the British that the troops began to think themselves
invincible. Repeated intelligence, however, still arrived
of French designs against Quebec, vague enough at first,
but, as the winter wore on, gradually assuming more
definite form. Lévis, the ablest officer left to the
French since the fall of Montcalm, was in fact straining
every nerve to organise and equip a force of overwhelming
strength for the purpose. He had full information
of the state of Murray's army and knew that he had
but to bide his time for scurvy to do the best part of
his work for him. At the end of March he heard that
half of the British were on the sick-list, and the report
was not far from the truth. By the middle of April
Murray had barely three thousand men fit for duty,
while no fewer than seven hundred were lying in the
snow-drifts, waiting till spring should unbind the frozen
ground to give them a grave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 21.<br />April 26.<br />April 27.</div>

<p>On the 17th of April Murray, learning that the
preparations of the French were complete, occupied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
mouth of Cap Rouge River to prevent a landing at that
point. Four days later Lévis set out with about seven
thousand men, half of them regular troops, and a fleet of
bateaux escorted by two frigates and by several smaller
craft. The river was not yet free from ice, the weather
was bad, and navigation was difficult; but on the 26th
the army, reinforced by the garrisons of several outlying
stations to nearly nine thousand men, landed at St.
Augustine and marched upon the British advanced posts.
The British at once fell back from Cap Rouge and Old
Lorette upon Sainte Foy. Lévis followed after them all
night, despite the difficulties of half-thawed ice and
driving rain and tempest, and at daybreak arrived before
Sainte Foy to find every house occupied by the British
and their cannon playing on his columns as they emerged
from the forest. Murray, warned by the information
of a French gunner, who had been picked up half dead
from the floating ice in the St. Lawrence, had marched
out with half of the garrison to cover the retreat of his
advanced parties. The position which he occupied was
strong, and Lévis being ignorant of the weakness of his
numbers would not venture to attack, but resolved to
wait until nightfall and then move round the British left
flank. Murray therefore was able to retire in safety to
Quebec, while Lévis occupied Sainte Foy and pushed his
light troops forward to Sillery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 28.</div>

<p>Murray's position now was none of the pleasantest.
The fortifications of Quebec were in no condition to
withstand an energetic cannonade, and the ground was
still frozen so hard that it was impossible for him to
throw up entrenchments, as he had long desired, outside
the walls. The only alternative open to him was to
sally out and fight Lévis, at odds of one against two,
and beat him if he could. Murray was young, daring
and fired by the example of Wolfe; his army was, as he
said, in the habit of beating the enemy;<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and he had a
fine train of artillery. He therefore resolved to go out
and fight. Accordingly at half-past six on the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of the 28th he marched out of Quebec at the head of
all the troops that he could muster, a bare three thousand
men, with three howitzers and twenty field-pieces, and
drew them up on the ground which Montcalm had
occupied on the famous 13th of September. The force
was formed in one line of two brigades, the right or
Burton's brigade consisting, from right to left, of the
Fifteenth, Fifty-eighth, second battalion of the Sixtieth,
and Forty-eighth regiments; the left or Fraser's brigade
of the Forty-third, Forty-seventh, Fraser's Highlanders,
and the Twenty-eighth. The Thirty-fifth and third
battalion of the Sixtieth were posted in reserve in rear of
the centre, while the Light Infantry and the Provincial
rangers stood wide on the right and left flanks. The
field-guns were distributed in pairs to each battalion.</p>

<p>Moving forward to reconnoitre, Murray perceived
that the French line was not yet formed. That Lévis
had chosen his ground was clear, for he had occupied
two block-houses built by the British above Anse du
Foulon at the southern edge of the plateau, as well as a
house and a fortified windmill at the northern brink,
and had extended his vanguard along the ridge between
these two points. But the main body was still debouching
in columns from Sillery Wood, a mile or more
in rear, and two brigades only were as yet deployed by
the block-house to form the French right wing. Thinking
the opportunity favourable, Murray ordered an
immediate advance; and his whole line moved forward,
the men dragging their guns with them in the intervals
between battalions. The ground was for the most part
still covered with snow, which in some places was piled
up in drifts and everywhere soft and sodden with rain;
and the tramp of three thousand men soon turned the
soil into a sea of mud. Arrived at the ground where
Wolfe's army had stood, the line halted, and the guns
unlimbering opened so destructive a fire on the French
columns that Lévis ordered the battalions of his left to
fall back to the woods. The manœuvre was not executed
without confusion, and Murray, elated by his apparent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
success, ordered the line to renew its advance, inclining
to its right. This movement, however, brought Burton's
brigade on to low ground, where the melting snow was
knee-deep and the guns could not be worked with effect.
The British Light Infantry attacked the windmill and
houses on the French left with great spirit, carried them
in spite of a desperate resistance, and pressed on in
pursuit of the retreating French. But now the battalions
of the French left, no longer checked by the fire of
artillery, dashed out of the woods in skirmishing order
and falling on the rash pursuers fairly overwhelmed
them. Over two hundred of the Light Infantry were
killed and wounded, and the few survivors hurrying
back in confusion upon Burton's brigade prevented it
from firing on the advancing enemy. The French
seized the opportunity to reform their broken ranks and
the combat was hotly maintained for more than an hour,
until ammunition for the British artillery failed, the
tumbrils being immovably fixed in the snow-drifts.</p>

<p>On Murray's left his hasty advance was little less
disastrous. The block-houses were indeed carried and
held for a time, but the French fell back into the woods
only to advance again in overwhelming force when the
fire of the British artillery failed, and to extend themselves
along the British front and flank. The two battalions of
the reserve were called up and the fight was maintained
with indomitable stubbornness; but with both flanks
turned the efforts of the British were hopeless, and
Murray gave the word to fall back. The men, though
but two in three of them remained unhurt, were furious
at the order. "Damn it, what is falling back but retreating!"
they said; but there was no help for it. So
first the left brigade and then the right retired, cursing
as they went. Some of the regiments tried to carry off
their guns with them, but finding this impossible owing
to deep snow and mud spiked and abandoned them.
The French followed in pursuit, hoping to cut them off
from the city; but Lévis perceiving the orderliness of
the retreat judged it more prudent to recall his troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
and Murray brought back the remnant of his force in
safety to Quebec.</p>

<p>So ended the action of Sainte Foy after two hours
of stern and bloody work. The loss of the British
amounted to a thousand killed and wounded or a full
third of the entire force. The Fifteenth, Twenty-eighth,
and Highlanders<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> were, after the Light Infantry, the
greatest sufferers, but in the attenuated state of the
battalions it is probable that in seven out of the ten there
fell at least one man in three. The loss of the French
was admitted to have exceeded eight hundred. Altogether
it was an unfortunate affair, though it cannot be
called discreditable to the troops. Murray was misled
by overweening confidence in his men and miscalculation
of the spirit of the French. His past experience doubtless
partly excused the mistake; but even if he had
failed to grasp that Lévis was a man who could restore
confidence to demoralised troops, he might at least have
guessed that he would bring up fresh regiments, who
had not learned to fear the red-coats, to meet him.
As things were, he sacrificed the advantages of his position
and of his superiority in artillery and found himself
shut up within the miserable fortifications of Quebec,
with his force reduced to twenty-four hundred men,
nominally fit for duty, but in reality, to use the expressive
words of one of them, "half-starved scorbutic
skeletons."</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 9.<br />May 16.</div>

<p>Murray, however, rose to the emergency with a spirit
worthy of a British officer. The troops were at first
inclined to break loose from discipline, but Murray
hanged the chief offender, staved in all the rum-barrels
of the sutlers and quickly restored order. Then every
soul of the garrison fell to work to strengthen the
defences. Officers yoked themselves to cannon and plied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
pickaxe and spade, and the men with such an example
before them strained themselves to the utmost. In a
short time one hundred and fifty guns were mounted
and at work on the walls of Quebec, while the French,
however they might toil at their trenches in the stubborn
soil of the plateau, had hardly brought up a single
cannon to answer them. None the less incessant labour
and bad food were telling heavily on the enfeebled
strength of the garrison, when on the 9th of May the
<i>Lowestoft</i> frigate sailed up to Quebec with the news
that a squadron was at the mouth of the river and
would arrive within a few days. The tidings put new
heart into the besieged, though had Lévis ventured on
an assault they would have found it hard to repel him.
On the 15th two more British men-of-war arrived at
Quebec, and next morning two frigates sailed up above
the city, attacked and destroyed Lévis' ships and with
them the French supplies of food and ammunition.
That same evening Lévis raised the siege and retreated
with precipitation, leaving behind him forty guns, the
whole of his material for the siege, and every man of his
sick and wounded. Murray marched at dawn to fall
upon his rear, but though he captured many stragglers
failed to overtake the main body. Thus Quebec was
saved; and the advent of spring, together with a
supply of fresh provisions, soon turned Murray's sickly
battalions into an army fit for service in the field.</p>

<p>During these miserable months of cold, privation,
and disease Amherst had been maturing his plans for
a decisive campaign. Pitt had enjoined the capture of
Montreal upon him as the principal object, and had
resolved to demolish the useless fortress of Louisburg,
thereby releasing the garrison for active service.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The
provincial assemblies were called upon once more to
furnish large contingents of troops for a supreme effort,
and the final blow was about to fall. Amherst's design
was to invade Canada simultaneously from east, west,
and south. Murray was to ascend the St. Lawrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
from Quebec; Brigadier Haviland was to break in by
Lake Champlain; and Amherst himself was to lead
the main army down the St. Lawrence from Lake
Ontario. Of the three lines of advance Amherst's
was not only the longest but the most difficult and
dangerous, owing to the rapids which obstruct the
navigation of the St. Lawrence; but on the other
hand the movement would cut off the retreat of the
French army to westward and force it back upon
Montreal, where Haviland and Murray would close
in upon it and fairly throttle it. The plan was delicate
in the extreme and called for the greatest nicety of
calculation, for the three armies must start from
three different points hundreds of miles apart without
possibility of inter-communication, and yet arrive at
their goal together, lest the French should concentrate
and overwhelm Murray's or Haviland's corps in
detail. The principal French posts for barring the
lines of advance were Île aux Noix at the head of Lake
Ontario, Sorel on the eastern side of Montreal, and La
Galette at the head of the rapids of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The year opened ill for Amherst. In March he
was compelled to send thirteen hundred men<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> to the
south to quell a rising of Cherokee Indians; and he
had not long communicated his instructions to Murray
when he received tidings of the defeat of Sainte Foy.
He at once summoned two battalions from Louisburg
to reinforce Murray, but it was not until late in June
that he was relieved by news of the safety of Quebec.
The provincial governments also were as usual a sore
trial and the cause of much vexatious delay;<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> but
Amherst was a man of tenacity and patience who
never lost sight of his object nor relaxed his industry
for a moment. At length, when midsummer was fully
past, the net which he had woven began to close round
the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">July.<br />August 4.</div>

<p>Murray was the first to move. His garrison had
rapidly recovered health and strength, and by July he
was able to pick out twenty-two hundred men for the
advance on Montreal, while still leaving seventeen
hundred behind him for the garrison of Quebec. On
the 14th of July his little column embarked in thirty-two
vessels with a number of boats and bateaux, and
on the following day set sail up the St. Lawrence,
leaving Lord Rollo to follow with the Twenty-second
and Fortieth Regiments, which had arrived from
Louisburg. Murray advanced slowly, skirmishing
with small parties of the enemy which hovered about
the flotilla on the shore, and disarming the inhabitants
as he passed. On the 4th of August he reached
Three Rivers, where lay a detachment of the French
army; but without delaying to attack it, he passed on
to Sorel, where Bourlamaque and M. Dumas with some
four thousand men were entrenched along both banks
of the river. These officers had been instructed to
follow up the flotilla as it moved, so British and
French alike advanced towards Montreal, where Lévis
lay with the main French army. Murray, meanwhile,
by rigour towards the recalcitrant and lenity towards
the submissive, persuaded half of Bourlamaque's militia
to yield up its arms and take an oath of neutrality.
By the 24th, being within nine leagues of Montreal,
he sent out a party to seek news of Haviland, and then
moving up to Île Sainte Thérése, just below Montreal,
he encamped and awaited the coming of his colleagues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August 27.</div>

<p>Haviland, meanwhile, had embarked in the third
week of August at Crown Point, with two battalions of
regulars, and with Provincials and Indians sufficient to
raise his force to thirty-four hundred men. Four days
brought him to Bougainville's position at Île aux Noix,
where he landed, erected batteries, and opened fire on
the fort; while at the same time a party of rangers
dragged three guns to the rear of the position and
turned them upon Bougainville's sloops of war, which
got under way in all haste and stranded in the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
bend of the river. Thus Bougainville's communications
with the next post, St. John's, down the river
Richelieu, were severed, and, as Amherst had foreseen,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
he was compelled to abandon the island. He joined
M. Roquemaure at St. John's with infinite difficulty
by a night march through the forest; and both
officers falling back from St. John's and Chambly
waited with Bourlamaque on the banks of the St.
Lawrence, where their force melted away fast through
desertion. Haviland opened communications with
Murray, and both awaited the approach of Amherst.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August 26.<br />Sept.<br />Sept. 5.</div>

<p>The main army had assembled at Oswego during
July, Amherst himself arriving on the 9th, but it was
not until the first week of August that the last of the
appointed regiments appeared at the rendezvous. The
force consisted of eight weak battalions of British,
numbering less than six thousand men, with four
thousand five hundred Provincials and seven hundred
Indians, or about eleven thousand in all. The flotilla
for the transport of the army was made up of nearly
eight hundred whale-boats and bateaux, and was
escorted by gun-boats. On the 10th of August the
entire force was embarked and by the 15th it had
reached Oswegatchie or La Galette, on the site of the
present Ogdensburg. Here a French brig of ten guns
was attacked and captured by the gun-boats, and the
flotilla pursued its way among the Thousand Islands.
On an islet at the head of the rapids stood a French
post named Fort Lévis, with a garrison of three
hundred men, which Amherst forthwith invested, and
after three days' cannonade reduced to surrender.
Repair of the fort and of his boats detained him until
the 30th, and on the 31st the expedition entered upon
the most critical of its work, the descent of the rapids.
On the 1st of September the flotilla was compelled
to proceed in single file, but all went well until the
4th, when the most dangerous of the rapids was
reached. On that day over sixty boats were wrecked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
or damaged and eighty-four men were drowned: but the
passage was accomplished without molestation from the
enemy, though large numbers of Canadians were on the
watch on the banks. The next day was consumed in
repairs, and on the 6th, the last rapid having been
passed, the boats glided down to La Chine, nine miles
from Montreal, on the left bank of the St. Lawrence.
Here the army landed unopposed, marched straight
upon Montreal and encamped beneath the walls on the
eastern side: while Haviland on the 8th arrived on
the southern shore against Amherst's camp. Amherst
was a little late, having been delayed by the resistance
of Fort Lévis. Had he been content to ignore it
and simply to cut it off from Montreal, he, Murray
and Haviland would have met, punctual to a day, on
the 29th of August. As it was the junction was
sufficiently complete, and the work of the campaign
was practically done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 8.</div>

<p>Bougainville, Bourlamaque, and Roquemaure had
crossed over to Montreal with the few regular troops
remaining with them, for the whole of their militia had
melted away, and even the regulars had been greatly
reduced by desertion. Thus the army assembled at
Montreal, the sole force that remained for the defence
of Canada, amounted to barely twenty-five hundred
men, demoralised in order, in spirit, and in discipline.
Around the city lay an hostile army of seventeen
thousand men; the fortifications were contemptible
except for defence against Indians, and Amherst's
cannon were already moving up from La Chine. The
French Governor called a council of war, which
resolved that resistance was hopeless. Articles of
capitulation were accordingly drawn up, and carried
on the 7th by Bougainville to Amherst. The condition
on which the French laid greatest stress was that they
should march out with the honours of war; but this
Amherst flatly refused. The troops, he said, must lay
down their arms and serve no further during the
present war: the French had played so inhuman a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
part in stirring up the Indians to treachery and barbarity
of every kind, that he was determined to make an
example of them. It is probable that the General
referred only to the massacre of the wounded after the
defeats at Fort William Henry, Ticonderoga, and the
Monongahela; but the reckoning to be paid went back
to earlier times. There were the wrongs, the encroachment
and the double-dealing of a full century to be
redressed; and the time for payment was come. In
vain the French pleaded for easier terms: Amherst, a
man not easily turned from his purpose, remained
inflexible. Accordingly on the 8th of September,
despite expostulation which rose almost to the point of
mutiny on the part of Lévis, the capitulation was signed,
and half a continent passed into the hands of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as if to crown the whole work and to
redeem all past failings and misfortunes, the expedition
against the Cherokee Indians had been brilliantly
successful. Trifling though the affair may seem in
comparison with Amherst's momentous operations in
the north, it marked the banishment of the panic fear
of Indians which had followed on the defeat of Braddock.
The command was entrusted to Colonel Montgomery,
and the force committed to him was four hundred of
the First Royals, seven hundred of his own Highlanders,
and a strong body of Provincials. Starting from
Charlestown, Carolina, Montgomery marched up one
hundred and fifty miles to the township of Ninety-six,
so called because it was supposed to be ninety-six miles
from the township of Keowee, and pushed forward
thence for four days through dense forest and mountainous
country without finding any sign of Indians.
Concluding therefore that the Cherokees were unaware
of his advance, he left all tents and baggage behind
and made a forced march to surprise the savages before
they could escape. The main body of the Indians,
however, retired before he could reach them; and he
could accomplish no more than the destruction of crops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
and villages, after which he returned to a fort on the
frontier, having traversed no less than sixty miles over
a most difficult country without a halt. It was then
resolved to begin the work anew and to make a fresh
advance into the forest. On this occasion the Indians
lay in wait for the British in a wooded valley and burst
upon them suddenly, as they had upon Braddock, with
hideous whooping and howling, and a scattered but
deadly fire of rifles. The grenadiers and Light Infantry
at once plunged into the forest to engage them, while
the Highlanders hastened round their rear to cut off
their retreat; and after a sharp action of an hour the
Indians were put to flight with great slaughter. This
engagement cost the British over eighty men killed and
wounded, twice as many as Amherst had lost by lead
and steel during the whole of his advance from Oswego
to Montreal. But the mere comparison of casualties
is of small moment. The really weighty matter is that
British officers had learned to face the difficulties which
had been fatal to Braddock, and to overcome them with
a light heart.</p>

<p>It now remained for Amherst to enforce the capitulation
on the French posts of the west. The occupation
of Detroit, Miamis, and Michillimackinac was entrusted
to Rogers, the partisan, with his rangers, who in the
course of the winter hauled down the ensign of the
Bourbons and hoisted the British flag in its place. There
was still to be trouble with these remote stations, but
it was not to come immediately, nor directly from the
French. The rest of the General's work was principally
administrative. Generous terms were granted to the
inhabitants, and every precaution was taken to protect
them against the Indian allies of the British. Amherst
issued a general order appealing to his troops not to
disgrace their victory by any unsoldierlike behaviour or
appearance of inhumanity; and the army responded to
the appeal with a heartiness which amazed the Canadians.
A month after the capitulation the General could report
that British soldiers and Canadian peasants were joining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
their provisions and messing together, and that when he
had ordered soldiers to leave their scattered quarters so
as to be closer to their companies, the people had begged
that they might not be moved.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Such was not the
fashion in which the French were wont to treat a
captured territory.</p>

<p>Here then for the present we may take leave of
Amherst. Pitt, as shall presently be seen, had further
tasks for him, which were to be executed as usual
quietly and thoroughly. The fame of the man is lost
in that of Wolfe, and yet it was he, not Wolfe, that was
the conqueror of Canada. The criticism usually passed
upon him is that he was sure but slow, and to some
extent it is justified by facts. Yet it should be remembered
that, when he took over the command, affairs in
North America were in extreme confusion and disorder,
and that the work assigned to him was, on a far larger
and more formidable scale, that which had fallen to
Cumberland in 1745. Braddock had started everything
in the wrong direction. Not only had he quarrelled
with the Provincials and failed to instruct his troops
aright, but he had deliberately forced them to follow
wrong methods. Loudoun, again, had not improved
relations with the provincial assemblies either by his
correspondence with them or by his military operations.
Finally Abercromby's imbecility at Ticonderoga had
sacrificed hundreds of valuable lives, disgusted the
colonists, and heightened the reputation gained by the
French at the Monongahela. Then Amherst took the
whole of the confused business in hand, and from that
moment all went smoothly and well; so smoothly indeed
that people quite forgot that it had ever gone
otherwise. Yet his difficulties with the Provincials were
not less than those of his predecessors nor less trying to
his patience than to theirs; nay, even the good-will of
the colonists was sometimes as embarrassing to him as
their obstruction. It must not be forgotten, moreover,
that the atmosphere of young communities, such as were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
then the North American colonies, is most noxious
to discipline. Americans, as their latest military effort
has proved, do not yet understand the meaning of the
term; the colonists of Australia and New Zealand,
which have no such religious traditions as America, have
but the vaguest conception of its significance. Thus
when Amherst returned from the conquest of Louisburg
to Boston, not all his efforts could prevent the inhabitants
of that godly city from filling his men with rum;
and the same spirit of indiscipline doubtless haunted the
army through all the long and dreary months of winter-quarters.
There was, again, the additional complication
that in the matter of forest-fighting the British had much
to learn from the Provincials; and it fell to Amherst
to teach his troops greater freedom and independence
in action without simultaneous relaxation of discipline.
He overcame all these obstacles, however, in his quiet,
methodical way. Discipline never failed; for Amherst,
though no martinet, could be inexorably severe.
Special corps of light troops and of marksmen were
organised, and the drill of the whole army was modified
to suit new conditions. It was in fact Amherst who
showed the way to the reform afterwards carried out by
Sir John Moore at Shorncliffe, of reducing the depth of
the ranks to two men only. Such a formation would
have diminished Wolfe's difficulties and materially have
strengthened his dispositions on the plains of Abraham:
but apparently so important an innovation never occurred
to him. Amherst never fought a great action,
so his improvements were never put to the test; but this
does not impair his credit as a soldier of forethought
and originality.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable quality in Amherst was
his talent for organisation. The difficulties of transport
in the Canada of his day were appalling. "Canada,"
says the American historian Parkman, "was fortified
with vast outworks of defence in the savage forests,
marshes, and mountains that encompassed her, where
the thoroughfares were streams choked with fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
trees and obstructed by cataracts. Never was the
problem of moving troops encumbered by artillery and
baggage a more difficult one. The question was less
how to fight an enemy than how to get at him." It
was just this problem which Amherst's industry and
perseverance had power to solve. We read of his
launching forth on to Lake George with a flotilla of
eight hundred boats and an army of eleven thousand
men, and all sounds simple and straightforward enough.
Yet these boats, setting aside the original task of building
and collecting them, had to make several journeys
to carry the necessary stores and provisions from
Albany to the head of the lake, while every one of them,
together with its load, required to be hauled overland
from three to six miles through forest and swamp
from the carrying-place on the Mohawk to Wood
Creek. The same provision against the same difficulties
were necessary on a smaller scale for Prideaux's attack
on Niagara, and, under conditions of special embarrassment,
for Stanwix's advance to the Ohio; while over
and above this, there was marine transport and all
necessaries for the expedition to Quebec to be provided,
so as to enable Wolfe to proceed on his mission fully
equipped and without delay. Add to this burden of
work endless correspondence with the various provinces,
as well as constant friction, obstruction, and general
dilatoriness, and it becomes apparent that for all his
slowness Amherst accomplished no small feat when he
achieved the conquest of Canada in two campaigns.</p>

<p>The whole problem was in truth one of organisation,
and Amherst was the man to solve it, for he was a great
military administrator. Cautious undoubtedly he was
in the field, but it would be absurd to contend that a
man who took ten thousand men down the rapids of
the St. Lawrence, with the dry comment that the said
rapids were "more frightful than dangerous,"<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> was
wanting in enterprise or audacity. His career as a
general in the field was short, and his crowning campaign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
having achieved its end without a general action,
has little fame. Such is the penalty of bloodless operations,
though they be the masterpiece of a mighty
genius. Austerlitz is a name familiar to thousands who
know nothing of the capitulation of Ulm. So Amherst
to the majority of Englishmen is but a name: as though
it were a small thing for a colonel taken straight from
the classic fields of Flanders to cross the Atlantic to a
savage wilderness, assume command of disheartened
troops and the direction of discordant colonists, and
quietly and deliberately to organise victory. He was
the greatest military administrator produced by England
since the death of Marlborough, and remained the
greatest until the rise of Wellington.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Authorities.</span>&mdash;The history of the French in Canada and of the

account of the operations. Knox's <cite>Journal</cite> is one of the most
valuable sources of information. Other authorities will be found

    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1755.</div>

<p class="noindent">It is now time to return to the subject of India, which,
as will be remembered, was dropped at the conclusion
of the truce between France and England in January
1755. Two days after the signing of the articles,
Governor Saunders left Madras for Europe, and was
followed a month later by M. Godeheu. It is not
likely that the departure of the two signatories of the
treaty wrought any great influence on the subsequent
proceedings of the East India Company; but certain it
is that before the instrument was a month old the infraction
of its provisions was already begun. It was in
fact impossible to observe the truce. Its object seems
to have been to terminate hostilities in the Carnatic
alone; but it was not to be expected that, while Bussy
was exerting his vast ability and energy at Aurungabad
for the promotion of French interests, the British could
sit with folded hands in submission to the article which
bound French and English alike "not to interfere in
any difference which might arise between the princes
of the country." The British had their puppet as well
as the French, and having used him for their own
purposes could not suddenly desert him, the less so
inasmuch as the Nabob Mohammed Ali had neither
resources of his own nor the wits whereby to provide
himself with them. When therefore Mohammed Ali
begged for a British force to reduce Madura and
Tinnevelly, which he conceived to be his tributaries, and
to collect his tribute for him, the authorities at Madras
assented without hesitation. It was, in fact, unusual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
not to say impossible, for Indian tribute to be levied
except by means of an armed force; and, since
Mohammed Ali had no troops of his own, it might be
maintained, at least with some show of reason, that the
furnishing of a small army for so innocent a purpose
was not an act of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">February.</div>

<p>Accordingly at the beginning of February twenty-five
hundred men, one-fifth of them Europeans, were
placed under command of Colonel Heron, an officer
lately arrived from England, who proceeded to perform
the duty assigned to him. It is unnecessary to enter
into details of his operations. Suffice it that he
succeeded not only in occupying both Madura and
Tinnevelly, but in demoralising his troops and insulting
the religious prejudices of the people by scandalous
pillage of a pagoda. Mohammed Ali made over the
government of the subdued territory to his brother
Maphuze Khan, and in June Heron, having done his
work, encamped before Trichinopoly. From thence he
was summoned to Madras to be tried by court-martial
for accepting bribes and for malversation of funds, and
was dismissed from the Company's service.</p>

<p>The French lost no time in protesting against this
expedition as a violation of the treaty, and with not the
less vigour that they were extremely jealous of the reuniting
of Madura and Tinnevelly, which had long
been severed from the sway of Arcot, to the dominions
of Mohammed Ali. The protest was of course
answered by indignant disclaimer of any sinister
purpose; and M. de Leyrit, the Governor of Pondicherry,
thought it more profitable to waste no further
words in argument, but simply to follow the British
example. An opportunity for doing so soon presented
itself. The chieftain of a tract of country known as
Terriore, about thirty miles north of Trichinopoly, had
for some time past evaded payment of his tributary
dues to Mysore. Now the Mysoreans on retiring from
Trichinopoly had appointed the French their agents to
watch over their interests in the Carnatic; and M. de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
Leyrit accordingly sent fifteen hundred men under M.
Maissin into Terriore to enforce discharge of the arrears
of this revenue. Maissin having fulfilled his mission
with ease and success led his army eastward to Palamcotah,
on territory which the British claimed to be
subject to Mohammed Ali. The authorities at Madras
threatened to stop him by force if he did not desist;
and, De Leyrit giving way, war was for the present
averted. But since both sides had now infringed the
treaty, it was plain that the renewal of hostilities could
not long be deferred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756.</div>

<p>The rest of the year passed away without serious
trouble; but, however the suspension of arms might
be observed in the south, there could be no safety for
the Carnatic while Bussy remained at Aurungabad,
virtually viceroy of the Deccan. He had been now
installed therein since 1751, wielding his great powers
with consummate tact and address in the face of
intrigue, jealousy, and even conspiracy; nay, he had
turned the most formidable of the combinations against
him into a means of increasing his influence and of
gaining nearly five hundred miles of the eastern coast,
from the Chilka Lake southward, for the government of
Pondicherry. It is true that this vast tract, which was
known as the Northern Sirkars, had for the most part
been restored to its native owners under the terms of
the treaty, but it was still held by France pending the
ratification of the articles, which was not expected to
arrive until the middle of 1756; and it was always
possible that so degrading a concession might be repudiated
at Versailles. Moreover, whatever the fate of
the negotiations, the cardinal fact remained that Bussy
continued always at the court of the Viceroy of the
Deccan, and that it was vital to the British that his
power should be undermined&mdash;that, in fact, Salabad
Jung should be persuaded or forced to dismiss him.
The first idea at Madras was to send a force to the
assistance of the Mahratta, Balajee Rao, who had
frequently carried on hostilities against Salabad Jung;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
for which duty Clive, who had returned to India with
the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and Governor of Fort
St. David, volunteered his services. Another officer,
however, was preferred to him, who died before the
work could be begun; and the authorities at Bombay,
from which side the operations were to be conducted,
allowed the project to drop. Native intrigue nevertheless
wrought effectually for the British what they could
not do for themselves; and in May the feeble Salabad
Jung was prevailed upon to dismiss Bussy and the
French troops from his service. But Bussy had still
an army with him, and had shown himself not less
formidable in the field than in the council-chamber; so
his enemies, to decide the matter, applied to Madras
for a body of troops to assist in the expulsion of the
French. No invitation could have been more pleasing.
A force of eighteen hundred men was at once ordered
for the service, when in the middle of July came
tidings from Bengal which demanded the presence of
every British soldier that could be spared from the
coast of Coromandel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.<br />May 9.<br />June.</div>

<p>The provinces of Bengal, Orissa, and Behar had
since 1735 been governed by a prince known to the
English as Allaverdy Khan, who, like all other viceroys
of the Moguls, had become virtually independent. At
his death the sovereignty descended, according to his
own nomination, to his great nephew Surajah Dowlah,
a youth who had early discovered propensities towards
cruelty, intemperance, and debauchery such as are rare
even in Oriental despots. Surajah Dowlah had always
hated the English, and his hatred was not lessened after
his succession by the fact that the most formidable of
his competitors for the throne had received asylum and
permission to deposit his treasures and his family at
Madras. At the beginning of April the authorities at
Calcutta received warning that the renewal of war with
France was inevitable, and accordingly set about the
repair of the fortifications of the settlement. Surajah
Dowlah, not only irritated but alarmed lest such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
preparations should be levelled against himself, sent
a message to the Governor requiring that the work
should cease and that the newly-erected defences should
be destroyed. The authorities answered by tendering
explanations; but the angry Nabob heard them only to
reject them, and ordered his army to march against the
fort and factory of Cossimbazar. The place was in no
condition to make any defence, and Surajah Dowlah
having received its surrender pursued his march upon
Calcutta. There the authorities, uninured to such trials
as Madras, had weakly endeavoured to appease the
wrath of the Nabob by desisting from further work on
the fortifications: nor was it until too late that they
discovered that their only safety lay in resistance.
Letters were hurriedly despatched to Bombay and
Madras for reinforcements, though with little hope that
these would reach Calcutta in time. Appeals for aid
were addressed also to the French at Chandernagore
and to the Dutch at Chinsura, but were rejected by
both parties, and by the French in particular with
studied insolence. By the 16th of June the Nabob's
army was before the city. Fort William, the principal
defence, was abandoned as untenable, and the British
resolved to confine their resistance to the streets. On
the 18th the enemy attacked and were gallantly beaten
back; but on the 19th they succeeded in carrying the
principal batteries: and it was then determined, while
there was yet time, to embark the women and children
on the shipping in the Hooghly. The resolution was
executed with a haste and disorder which soon turned
to panic, and there was a general rush to escape. The
Governor, who so far had shown firmness and courage,
embarked with the rest, and the scanty remnant of
Europeans left behind in Calcutta was compelled to
capitulate. The tragedy that ensued is well known&mdash;how
one hundred and forty-six Europeans were packed
during the insufferable heat of a summer's night into a
room not twenty feet square and with but two small
windows; how the unhappy creatures strove for a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
to fight with order and discipline against suffocation;
how the effort proved, as it could not but prove,
beyond their powers, and gave place to a succession of
mad struggles for life, renewed and renewed again
through hour after hour till at length they were closed
by the slow mercy of death; and how when the corpses
were cleared away from the door in the morning
thirty-three ghastly figures staggered out from among
them to tell to their countrymen the tale of the Black
Hole of Calcutta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>The Nabob then occupied himself with the plunder
of the city and in writing inflated accounts of his conquest
to Delhi; which done he left a garrison of three
thousand men in Calcutta and departed with his army
on the 2nd of July. On his way he extorted large
contributions from Chandernagore and Chinsura as the
price of their immunity, and so returned to his capital
of Moorshedebad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 20.<br />August.<br />December.</div>

<p>It was not until the 15th of July that the news of
the fall of Cossimbazar reached Madras. Two hundred
and thirty Europeans under Major Kilpatrick were
promptly shipped off to the Hooghly, and arrived at
Fulta, five-and-twenty miles below Calcutta, on the
2nd of August. But there was long hesitation as to the
expediency of sending further reinforcements to Bengal.
News was daily expected of declaration of war with
France, and it was held by many of the Council that it
would be wiser policy to send aid to Salabad Jung and
to complete the discomfiture of Bussy while there was yet
time. Fortunately wider and less selfish views prevailed,
and ultimately it was decided to send every ship and
man that could be spared to the Hooghly. There was
still longer debate over the selection of a commander,
but the choice finally fell upon Clive, though he was
subordinated to Admiral Watson, who commanded the
British squadron then lying at Madras. The force
entrusted to him consisted of nine hundred Europeans,
two hundred and fifty of which were of the Thirty-ninth
regiment, and fifteen hundred Sepoys. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
at last on the 15th of October the transports sailed
under convoy of Admiral Watson's four ships of the
line, though, owing to divers misfortunes, it was
Christmas before the bulk of the fleet arrived at Fulta.
Even then two ships, the one containing two hundred
European troops, the other the great part of the field-artillery,
were still missing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 29.</div>

<p>Even more discouraging was the condition of
Kilpatrick's detachment which, being perforce encamped
on unhealthy ground, had buried over one hundred
men and could supply but thirty that were fit for duty.
Still there was nothing to be gained by delay, so on the
27th of December the fleet sailed up the river and on
the 29th anchored at Mayapore, two miles below the
fort of Budge Budge. Here, contrary to Clive's opinion,
Watson insisted that the troops should march against
the fort overland. Five hundred Europeans and the
whole of the Sepoys were accordingly disembarked, and
after a most difficult march arrived at the place appointed
for camp, a large hollow situated between two villages
a mile and a half to north-east of Budge Budge. The
men being greatly fatigued were permitted to leave
their arms in the hollow and to lay themselves down
wherever they thought best; and with inexcusable
neglect not a sentry was posted. It so happened that
Monichund, the officer left by Surajah Dowlah at
Calcutta, had that very day reached Budge Budge with
thirty-five hundred men, where on receiving intelligence
of Clive's dispositions he laid his plans to attack him at
nightfall. The British troops had not been long asleep
when they were awaked by the fire of musketry and
found the enemy upon them. Instantly they rushed
to the hollow for their arms, the artillerymen deserting
their guns and flying back with the infantry to take
shelter. Clive, always cool and collected, called to his
men to stand, knowing that the slightest retrograde
movement would produce a panic, and detached two
platoons from two different points to make a counter-attack.
The British then recovered themselves, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
artillerymen returned to their guns, and Clive was able
to form his line in order for a general advance. Before
the action could become general a round shot passing
close to Monichund's turban caused that officer to give
a hasty signal for retreat; and so Clive's army was
saved, though, indeed, it was by no fault but his own
that it had been endangered. H.M.S. <i>Kent</i> then sailed
up and silenced the guns of Budge Budge; and on the
following night a drunken sailor, who chanced to blunder
into the fort, made the discovery that it had been
abandoned by the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 30.<br />1757.<br />Jan. 12.<br />Feb. 2.<br />Feb. 3.</div>

<p>On the 30th the fleet pursued its way up to Alighur,
where Clive again landed with the army to march on
Calcutta, while the ships engaged the enemy at Fort
William. The Nabob's troops soon deserted both fort
and town, and the fort was occupied, before Clive could
reach it, by a detachment under Captain Eyre Coote of
the Thirty-ninth Foot, who had sailed from England
with two companies of his regiment in the previous
November. It was then resolved to recapture Hooghly
before the Nabob could advance from Moorshedabad;
and accordingly three hundred and fifty of the Thirty-ninth
with a due proportion of Sepoys were detached
for the purpose, who took the town by storm with
trifling loss and a week later returned to Calcutta.
Meanwhile news arrived of the outbreak of war between
France and England; and the Company fearing lest the
French troops at Chandernagore, who numbered three
hundred Europeans with a train of artillery, might join
the Nabob, endeavoured to come to terms with him.
The attempt was vain. Surajah Dowlah, irritated by
the attack on Hooghly, collected an army of forty
thousand men and moved steadily upon Calcutta. On
the 2nd of February his advanced guard came into sight;
whereupon Clive, who had taken up a position at the
northern end of the town, marched out as if to attack.
He decided, however, to wait for a more favourable
moment; and on the following day the whole of the
Nabob's army was encamped along the eastern side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
the town, beside the entrenchment that bore the name
of the Mahratta Ditch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feb. 4.</div>

<p>Even then, though the French had not joined Surajah
Dowlah, Clive was loth to encounter his army without
reinforcements, and made a last effort at negotiation;
but, on the return of his commissioners without success,
he decided to make an attempt upon the enemy's camp
on the morrow. At midnight six hundred sailors were
landed from the men-of-war, and with these, six hundred
and fifty European infantry, a hundred gunners with
six guns, and eight hundred Sepoys Clive started before
dawn for the Nabob's encampment. His advance was
made in a long column of three men abreast, with the
artillery in rear; and day had just broken when he struck
against the enemy's advanced posts and drove them
back. With the coming of the light there came also a
dense fog, through which the column continued to move
forward, successfully repulsing an attack of the enemy's
cavalry as it went, until a causeway was reached, running
at right angles to the line of march, which led to the
Nabob's quarters within the Mahratta Ditch. There
the head of the column changed direction to the right,
as it had been bidden, but in the perplexity caused by
the fog found itself under the fire of the British field-guns
in the rear, and broke up to seek shelter. This
movement misled the rear of the column; and very soon
the entire force was in hopeless confusion. The enemy
opening fire with their cannon increased the disorder;
and Clive had much ado to keep his men together.
Finally when the fog lifted he found himself surrounded
by the enemy's cavalry; and though he succeeded in
driving them off he was obliged, owing to the fatigue
of his troops, to abandon the attack and return to camp.
His losses amounted to one hundred Europeans and fifty
Sepoys killed and wounded, against which there seemed
little gain to be set. The men indeed were not a little
disheartened, and complained with some bitterness of
the rashness of their leader.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feb. 9.<br />March.<br />June 4.<br />June 13.</div>

<p>But if the British were discouraged, much more so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
was the Nabob. Blind and uncertain though the action
had been, he had lost six hundred men and five hundred
horses, while the idea of a British force calmly perambulating
his camp was utterly distasteful and disquieting
to him. Five days later he concluded a treaty whereby
he agreed to restore all property taken at Calcutta and
to revive all other privileges formerly granted to the
British; an agreement which was expanded forty-eight
hours afterwards into an offensive and defensive alliance.
Clive then proposed to attack the French at Chandernagore,
but this the Nabob positively forbade. In
March, however, reinforcements of three companies of
infantry and one of artillery arrived from Bombay, and
Clive resolved to make the attack notwithstanding the
Nabob's prohibition. On the 7th of March the army
began its march up the river; the siege was opened a
week later, and the fort, which held no very strong
garrison, was soon forced to capitulate. This defiance
of his wishes increased at once the Nabob's dread of
the British and his anxiety to evade the obligations of
the treaty. The miserable creature writhed under the
masterful spirit of Clive. He made overtures to Bussy,
to the Mahrattas, to any one whom he thought able to
help him out of his difficulties: sometimes he threatened
the English, sometimes he apologised to them; and
Clive, thoroughly distrustful of this abject ally, determined
to keep the whole of his army in Bengal to watch
him and hold him to his obligations. Meanwhile aid
suddenly reached the British from an unexpected source.
The followers of the Nabob, alienated by his folly, his
insults, and his caprice, began to fall away from him.
Discontent ripened into disaffection, and disaffection into
conspiracy. Overtures were presently made to the
authorities at Calcutta to join in a plot for the overthrow
of Surajah Dowlah and for the setting up of
Meer Jaffier, hitherto his commander-in-chief but now
foremost among the conspirators, in his place. Long
negotiations followed, which have become famous for
the blot which, rightly or wrongly, they have left upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
the memory of Clive. Finally Meer Jaffier signed the
treaty which bound the English to win for him the
throne of Bengal, Orissa, and Behar, and engaged himself
in return to make over to them all French factories
within those provinces, as well as a slight accession of
territory about Calcutta, and to give compensation for
the damage inflicted by Surajah Dowlah. Meer Jaffier,
however, had displayed considerable irresolution during
the negotiations, and the secret of the conspiracy had
already begun to leak out, so that it became necessary
to clench the arrangement by immediate action. Accordingly
on the 13th of June, Clive, who had been
throughout the leading and deciding spirit, set his force
in motion from Chandernagore upon Moorshedabad,
and on the following day sent a letter to the Nabob
which amounted virtually to a declaration of war.</p>

<p>Before the letter arrived Surajah Dowlah had awaked
to his peril and sent emissaries to treat with Meer
Jaffier; nay, throwing off all royal state he visited his
former vassal in person to entreat humbly for reconciliation.
Meer Jaffier yielded; the agreement between the
two men was ratified by the usual oaths on the Koran;
and Surajah Dowlah, returning a defiant answer to Clive,
ordered the whole of his army to assemble some twelve
miles due south of Moorshedabad at the village of Plassey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Clive continued his advance up the
Hooghly, the Europeans travelling by water in boats,
the Sepoys marching along the western bank. His
force consisted in all of nine hundred Europeans,
two hundred half-bred Portuguese and twenty-one
hundred Sepoys, with ten guns. On the 16th he
halted at Paltee, on the Cossimbazar river above its
junction with the Jelingeer, and sent forward Major
Eyre Coote to secure the fort of Cutwa, twelve miles
farther up, which commanded the passage of the river.
The governor of the fort was one of the conspirators
against Surajah Dowlah, but he met Coote's overtures
with defiance, and on the deployment of the British
force for attack set fire to the defences and retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
together with his garrison. Clive's force encamped
in the plain of Cutwa that night; but the behaviour of
the Governor was calculated to disquiet him, for Meer
Jaffier's letters only reported vaguely that he himself,
though reconciled to the Nabob, intended none the
less to abide by the treaty with the British. Distrusting
so ambiguous a declaration Clive decided not to
cross the river into what was called the Island of
Cossimbazar,<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> until his doubts should be resolved. On
the 20th further letters arrived from Meer Jaffier
tending somewhat to allay Clive's misgivings as to
his good faith, but holding out little hope of assistance
in the coming operations; while simultaneously there
came a letter from one of Clive's agents which gave
some reason for doubting Meer Jaffier's sincerity.
Much perplexed Clive summoned a council of war, and
put it to the twenty officers therein assembled whether
it would be better to cross the river and attack the
Nabob at all hazards, or to halt at Cutwa, where
supplies were abundant, until the close of the rainy
season, and meanwhile to invoke the assistance of the
Mahrattas. He gave his own opinion first in favour
of remaining at Cutwa, and was followed by thirteen
of the officers, including so bold a soldier as Kilpatrick.
Coote and six more, however, gave their votes for
immediate action or return to Calcutta. Clive broke
up the council, retired alone into an adjoining grove
for an hour, and on his return issued orders to cross
the river on the morrow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 23.</div>

<p>At sunrise of the 22nd the army began the passage
of the river, and by four in the afternoon it stood
on the eastern bank. Here another letter reached
Clive from Meer Jaffier, giving information as to the
intended movements of the Nabob. Clive's answer
was that he should advance to Plassey at once, and
on the following morning to Daoodpoor, six miles
beyond it; and that if Meer Jaffier failed to meet him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
there, he would make peace with Surajah Dowlah.
The troops accordingly proceeded on their way,
Europeans by water, Sepoys by land; but owing to
the slow progress of the boats against the stream, it
was one o'clock in the morning before they had
traversed the fifteen miles to the village of Plassey.
Here they were surprised to learn from the continued
din of drums and cymbals that the Nabob's army was
close at hand; for they had expected to meet with it
farther north. Solaced by this rude music the men
lay down in a mango-grove to sleep; but the officers
that slept were few, and Clive was not one of them.</p>

<p>The grove of Plassey extended north and south
for a length of about half a mile, with a width of
about three hundred yards. The trees were planted
in regular rows, and the whole was surrounded by a
slight bank and by a ditch beyond it, choked with
weeds and brambles. The grove lay at an acute angle to
the river, the northern corner being fifty yards and the
southern two hundred yards from the bank. A little to
the northward of it and on the edge of the river stood
a hunting-house of the Nabob, surrounded by a garden
and wall. A mile to northward of this house the river
makes a huge bend to the south-west in the form of
a horse-shoe, containing a peninsula of about a mile in
diameter, which shrinks at its neck to a width of some
five hundred yards from stream to stream. About
three hundred yards to south of this peninsula an
entrenchment had been thrown up, which ran for above
a furlong straight inland and parallel to the grove,
and then turned off at an obtuse angle to the north-eastward
for about three miles. The whole of the
Nabob's army was encamped within this entrenchment
and the peninsula, and the angle itself was defended
by a redoubt. Some three hundred yards to the
east of the redoubt, but outside the entrenchment,
stood a hillock covered with trees; half a mile to
southward of this hillock lay a small tank, and yet
a hundred yards farther south a second and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
larger tank, both of them surrounded by a mound of
earth.</p>

<p>At dawn the Nabob's forces began to stream by
many outlets from the camp towards the grove, a
mighty host of thirty-five thousand foot, eighteen
thousand horse, and fifty pieces of artillery. The
cannon were for the most part of large calibre and
were carried, together with their crews and ammunition,
on large stages, which were tugged by forty or
fifty yoke of oxen in front and propelled by elephants
from behind. Forty or fifty French adventurers under
M. St. Frais, who had formerly been of the garrison
of Chandernagore, took post with four light field-guns
at the larger tank, which was nearest to the grove;
while two heavy guns under a native officer were
posted to St. Frais's right and between him and the
river. In support of these advanced parties were five
thousand horse and seven thousand foot under the
Nabob's most faithful general, Meer Murdeen. The
rest of the hostile army extended itself in a huge curve
from the hillock before the entrenchments to within
half a mile of the southern angle of the grove. Thus
the British could not advance against the force in their
front without exposing themselves to overwhelming
attack on their right flank.</p>

<p>Clive watched these dispositions from the hunting-house,
and was surprised at the numbers and confidence
of the enemy. But knowing that his only
chance was to assume a bold face, he drew his troops
out of the grove and formed them in a single
line, with their left resting on the hunting-house and
their front towards the nearest tank. The European
battalion occupied the centre of the line. It mustered
on that day about seven hundred men, partly of the
Company's troops, since numbered the Hundred and
First to the Hundred and Third Regiments, and partly
of the Thirty-ninth Foot, while one hundred half-bred
Portuguese also were ranked within it. Three six-pounders
were posted on each flank of this battalion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
manned by fifty men of the Royal Artillery and as
many seamen; and to right and left of these
guns, twenty-one hundred Sepoys were drawn up in
two equal divisions. The line extended for six
hundred yards beyond the grove, but the enemy at this
point was too remote to fall upon the British flank
before dispositions could be made to meet them. Two
more field-guns and two howitzers were posted two
hundred yards in advance of the left division of Sepoys,
under shelter of two brick-kilns. Therewith Clive's
order of battle was complete; and the handful of three
thousand men stood up to meet its fifty thousand
enemies. Its strength lay in the group of white faces
in the centre, and the strength of that group lay in the
will of one man. It was the first time that British
troops had faced such odds; but it was not to be the
last.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the action was opened by the firing
of one of the French guns at the tank. The shot fell
true, killing one man and wounding another of the
British grenadier-company. Then the whole of the
enemy's guns, from the tanks in front along the whole
vast sweep of the curving line, opened a heavy and continuous
fire. The British guns replied and with effect,
but the loss of one of Clive's soldiers was ill compensated
for by the fall of ten of the enemy; and after losing
thirty men in the first half hour of the cannonade
Clive ordered the whole of his force to fall back into
the grove. So the little band of scarlet faced about,
passed into the trees and vanished from sight; while
wild yells of elation rose up from the enemies that
ringed them about, and their whole line closing in
nearer upon the grove renewed the cannonade with
redoubled energy. The shot, however, did little damage,
for the British had been ordered to lie down; and Clive's
field-guns, firing through embrasures made in the bank,
wrought greater destruction, at the closer range, than
before. So the duel of artillery continued until eleven
o'clock, when Clive called a council of officers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
decided that it would be best to maintain the position
until nightfall, and at midnight to take the offensive
and attack the enemy's camp.</p>

<p>Then by chance nature interposed, as at Créçy, to
change the whole aspect of the fight. A heavy storm
of rain swept over the plain, drenching both armies to
the skin. The British had tarpaulins ready to cover
their ammunition; but the enemy had taken no such
precaution, and consequently most of their powder was
damaged. Their fire began to slacken, while that of
the British was as lively as ever. Nevertheless, believing
that his adversary must be in the same predicament as
himself, Meer Murdeen advanced from the tank towards
the grove to drive the British from it. His troops were
met by a deadly fire of grape, his cavalry was dispersed
and he himself mortally wounded. The news of his
fall shattered the shaken nerves of the unhappy Nabob,
and in abject despair he sent for Meer Jaffier and besought
earnestly for his help. He, the sovereign, flung
his turban at the feet of his subject and cried, "Jaffier,
that turban you must defend." And Jaffier, with the
readiness of submissive gesture which graces Oriental
duplicity, bowed his head and laid his hands upon his
breast, swearing to render his utmost service. Then
returning to his fellow-conspirators he forthwith despatched
a letter to Clive, advising him to push forward
at once, or at all events to attack the Nabob before next
dawn. The messenger was afraid to deliver the letter
while the fire continued; but Surajah Dowlah, as though
aware that no faithful counsellor was left to him, turned
to another of his leaders for help. This man, being also
of the conspirators, advised him to order the army to
fall back within the entrenchment and himself to retire
to the capital, leaving the issue of the fight to his
Generals. The wretched Nabob acted on this counsel,
and mounting a camel set forth with an escort of two
thousand horse for Moorshedabad. Thus it was that
at about two o'clock the enemy's fire ceased, the
teams were harnessed to the guns, and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
host turning about flowed back slowly towards the
entrenchments.</p>

<p>While all this was going forward, Clive, having
resolved to make no offensive movement before night,
had retired to the hunting-house to snatch a few minutes
of sleep after the anxiety and fatigue of the previous
day. He was roused by a message from Major Kilpatrick
which brought him back speedily into the field.
Despite the withdrawal of the Nabob's army St. Frais and
his little party still held their position in the tank, and
Kilpatrick, perceiving that the position was one from
which the enemy's flank could be cannonaded during
their retreat, sent word to Clive that he was about to
attack it. Clive, waked abruptly from sleep, sharply
reprimanded Kilpatrick for taking such a step without
orders; but presently seeing that the Major was right,
he took command of his two companies, and sending
Kilpatrick to bring forward the rest of the army,
himself led the advance against the tank.</p>

<p>St. Frais, aware that he could hold his ground no
longer, thereupon limbered up, and retiring with perfect
coolness to the redoubt at the angle of the entrenchment,
made ready for action once more. Meanwhile,
during the advance of the British, the southernmost
division of the Nabob's army was observed to be holding
aloof from the rest of the host and approaching
nearer to the grove. These were the troops of Meer
Jaffier, but their movement was misconstrued as a design
upon the boats and baggage in the grove; and accordingly
three platoons and a field-gun were detached to
hold them in check. The division therefore retired
slowly, but still remained significantly apart from the
remainder of the host. But before this, the main body
of the British had reached the tank, and planting their
artillery on the mound opened fire on the enemy behind
their entrenchments. Thereupon many of the Nabob's
troops faced about again and moved out into the plain
to meet them; the infantry opening a heavy fire, while
the artillery likewise wheeled about to enter the fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
anew. In effect it was at this moment that the true
battle began, though the Nabob's force was by this time
without leader or general. Clive perceived that his only
chance was to press his attack home before the resistance
to him could assume any organised form. He therefore
pushed forward half of his infantry and artillery to
the lesser tank, and the remainder to some rising ground
a furlong to the left of it, at the same time detaching a
hundred and fifty men to occupy a tank close to the
entrenchments and to keep up a fire of musketry upon
them. From these stations the firing was renewed at
closer range than before and with admirable efficiency.
The enemy suffered great loss, and the teams attached
to their heavy artillery were so much cut up that the
guns could not be brought into action. Nevertheless
St. Frais's field-pieces at the redoubt were still well and
regularly served; and the enemy, though lacking leadership,
were able, under favour of the ground and of their
immense superiority in numbers, to carry on the fight
with some spirit in their own irregular fashion. The
entrenchments themselves, the hillock to eastward of the
redoubt, and every hollow or coign of vantage, were
crammed with matchlockmen, while the cavalry hovered
round, threatening continually to charge, though always
kept at a distance by the British artillery. At length it
dawned upon Clive that the isolated division of the
Nabob's army by the grove must be that of Meer
Jaffier, and that his flank and rear were safe. He
resolved therefore to cut matters short. Two parties
were detached to make simultaneous attack upon the
redoubt on one side and the hillock on the other, while
the main body moved up between them in support.
The hillock was carried without the firing of a shot,
and St. Frais, perceiving that he was now wholly unsupported,
abandoned his guns and retired. At five
o'clock the British were in possession of the Nabob's
entrenchments and camp, and the battle of Plassey was
won.</p>

<p>From a military standpoint the action has comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
little interest, since the issue turned really on the
good faith or, if the term be preferred, the ill-faith of
the leading conspirators against Surajah Dowlah. The
British could not advance until the enemy retired; it
was a shower of rain that silenced the Nabob's artillery
and began the discouragement which led to their retreat;
and even then the British commander needed to be
waked out of sleep to follow them. There were no such
superb audacity of attack, no such bloody struggle, no
such triumph of discipline over numbers, as were to be
seen afterwards at Meeanee. The whole loss of the
British amounted to but seven Europeans and sixteen
Sepoys killed, thirteen Europeans and thirty-six Sepoys
wounded. It was a small price to pay for dominion
over the provinces of Bengal, Orissa, and Behar, for such
and no less were the fruits of the victory. Yet it is not
by the mere tale of the slaughtered and the maimed
that such successes must be judged. The victory may
have been easily won when the moment came for the
actual clash of arms; but the main point is that the
British were there to win it. The campaign of Plassey
is less a study of military skill than of the iron will and
unshaken nerve that could lead three thousand men
against a host of unknown strength, and hold them
undaunted, a single slender line, within a ring of fifty
thousand enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 24.<br />1758.</div>

<p>The day's work did not end with the capture of the
camp. Eyre Coote was sent forward with a detachment
to keep the enemy moving, and the army encamped
for the night at Daoodpoor. On the following
day Meer Jaffier was saluted by Clive as Nabob of
Bengal, Orissa, and Behar, after which he hastened with
his troops to Moorshedabad, reaching the city on the
same evening. Surajah Dowlah had fled before his
arrival, but parties were sent out at once in search of
him, and a few days later he was brought back and
assassinated. On the 29th Clive likewise entered the
city and formally installed Meer Jaffier on the throne.
He then spent the succeeding months in dividing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
spoils of the victory, of which the troops received no
small share, and in securing that British interests should
be paramount in the new possessions, or, to use plain
language, that the Company should be the true sovereign
and Meer Jaffier its puppet. On this part of his task
I shall for the present dwell no further, except to
mention that the agent selected by him to reside at
the Court of Meer Jaffier was a young man of five-and-twenty,
named Warren Hastings. The work was
not fully accomplished for many months, nor was it
until the following May that Clive was able to return
to Calcutta, having left the greater number of his troops
at Cossimbazar to keep watch over Moorshedabad.
A month before his arrival events in Southern India
had taken a ply which called for the appointment of
the ablest possible man as ruler of Bengal; and in
June Clive, at the request of the authorities at Calcutta,
assumed the office of President. Before long his hand
will again be seen busy in the direction of new
conquests; but it is necessary first to trace the course
of events in Southern India.</p>

<p class="noindent">It might have seemed that, with the recall of Dupleix
and the dismissal of Bussy from the court of Salabad
Jung, French ascendency in India was already shaken
to its foundations. Such, however, was very far from
the fact. On the news of Bussy's withdrawal the
French governors both at Pondicherry and at Masulipatam
had sent him reinforcements, which he contrived
by rare skill and daring to join to his own troops, and
to use so effectively that within three months of his dismissal
he was re-established at Hyderabad with all his
former titles, dignities, and honours. For the rest of
the year he was fully occupied in the reassertion of his
position at the Viceroy's court and of French influence
in the Northern Sirkars, those provinces on the eastern
seaboard which, as will be remembered, should by the
treaty of 1755 have been restored to their native
owners. The most dangerous enemy of the British,
therefore, though not removed, was fully employed
over his own affairs during the year 1756. No sooner
was he free, however, than he was once again busy in
mischief, reducing Vizagapatam and the British factories
on the Godavery, until new intrigues at the Court of
the Viceroy recalled him hurriedly to Hyderabad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.</div>

<p>Still farther south, at Trichinopoly, matters remained
for a time comparatively quiet. Major Caillaud,
who commanded the garrison of the city, had received
strict orders to abstain from all hostilities; while the
French, though still in occupation of Seringham, had
been so much weakened by the detachment of reinforcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
for the help of Bussy, that until December 1756
they ceased to be formidable. In the following
February, however, the dread of French intrigue at
Madura and Tinnevelly had forced Caillaud to lead an
expedition to both of these districts; and in April the
necessity for collecting the revenues of the Nabob
Mohammed Ali led the authorities at Madras to send
a further expedition to Nellore on the river Pennar.
This latter enterprise was unsuccessful, but has a distinct
interest of its own for that it was entrusted to
Lieutenant-Colonel Forde of the Thirty-ninth Foot, an
officer who was soon to win for his name a place beside
those of Clive and Lawrence. In this his first command,
however, he failed; and the French, though they had
received orders to attempt nothing before the arrival
of reinforcements, could not resist the temptation to
take the field while the forces of Madras were divided
between two points so remote as Tinnevelly and Nellore.
M. d'Auteuil therefore seized the moment to collect
four thousand men, one-fourth of them Europeans,
together with a train of siege-artillery, and on the 14th
of May appeared with this force before Trichinopoly.
The position of the British garrison was never more
critical during the whole course of the war than at this
moment. The best of the troops were absent with
Caillaud; and Captain Joseph Smith, who was left in
command, had but seven hundred Sepoys and less than
two hundred English with which to hold the fortifications
and to guard five hundred French prisoners who
were still within the walls. D'Auteuil, thinking to
capture Trichinopoly at small cost, tried to scare Smith
into surrender by bombardment and by incessant petty
attacks, but Smith was not easily frightened and held
his ground until the 25th. Then Caillaud appeared,
having hastened back with all speed from Madura, and
by extreme skill and perseverance passed his force by
night unnoticed through the midst of the French camp
into the city. D'Auteuil thereupon retired to Pondicherry,
and Trichinopoly was once more in safety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the authorities <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'a Madras had'">at Madras had</ins> initiated
a diversion in favour of Trichinopoly, to which the
French answered by reprisals in kind; but the operations
were of little interest or significance. In September
a French squadron arrived which disembarked one
thousand regular troops; but even after the arrival of
this reinforcement the enemy's movements were of
small importance. Indeed their inactivity at this period
was no less surprising than welcome to the British, for
the Presidency of Madras, in the face of their superior
numbers, had been obliged to withdraw all its troops
into garrison and to stand strictly on the defensive.
The secret of the French forbearance was that the
Governor of Pondicherry, having received positive
orders from France to await the arrival of further
succours, was fain to content himself with the reduction
of a few of the outlying forts of the Carnatic. Thus
the campaign of 1757 closed with the advantage to the
French of the capture of Chittapett, a post thirty miles
south of Arcot, and to the British of the acquisition of
Madura.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758.<br />April.</div>

<p>The year 1758 opened far more seriously for the
British. At daybreak on the 28th of April a fleet of
twelve sail was seen standing into the roadstead of Fort
St. David and was presently recognised to be French.
This was the long-expected armament on which the
French had built all their hopes for the expulsion of
the British from India, and it had consumed nearly
twelve months in its passage. It had left Brest
originally in March 1757 and had been driven back
by foul weather. Then two line-of-battle ships had
been taken from it for service in Canadian waters, and
the squadron had waited till May for their place to be
supplied by two French East Indiamen fitted out as
ships of war. Then the Admiral, d'Aché, for all that
a British fleet was hurrying after him, loitered on the
voyage to Mauritius, and on leaving that island selected
a course which kept him three months on his passage
to Coromandel. At last, however, the squadron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
arrived in the roadstead of Fort St. David, having lost
by that time between three and four hundred men
through sickness. It carried on board Lally's regiment
of infantry and fifty European artillerymen, together
with Count Lally himself, who had been appointed to
the supreme command of the French in India. Lally
de Tollendal, or to give him his real name, O'Mullally
of Tullindally (for he was of Irish extraction), was an
officer who had been of the Irish brigade in the French
service, and who enjoyed the credit of having suggested
that movement of the artillery which had shattered the
British column to defeat at Fontenoy. How far this
training would avail him in India remained still to be
seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 29.</div>

<p>Lally's instructions from Versailles directed him
first to besiege Fort St. David; and accordingly he
himself sailed at once with three ships from that roadstead
to Pondicherry to give the necessary orders, while
the rest of the fleet worked down two miles to southward
and dropped anchor off Cuddalore. But now the
consequences of the long protraction of Admiral d'Aché's
voyage began to reveal themselves. Commodore Stevens,
who had left England with his squadron three months
after him, had reached Madras five weeks before him,
and joining with Admiral Pocock's squadron in the
Hooghly had sailed with it on the 17th of April to
intercept d'Aché. Pocock having missed the French
squadron on his voyage south bore up to the northward,
and on the morning of the 29th came in sight
of it at its moorings before Cuddalore. D'Aché at
once weighed anchor and stood out to sea; but owing
to the heavy sailing of some of the English vessels it was
not until the afternoon that Pocock could engage him,
with seven ships against nine. The action that ensued
though indecisive was decidedly to the disadvantage of
the French. They lost six hundred men killed and
wounded, while one of their ships of the line was so
badly damaged that she was perforce run ashore and
abandoned. The British ships lost little over a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
men, though on the other hand their rigging was so
much cut up that they were unable to pursue the
enemy. Pocock therefore returned to Madras to refit,
while the French fleet anchored some twenty miles
north of Pondicherry in the roadstead of Alumparva.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 30.<br />May 1.<br />May 6.</div>

<p>On the self-same day, under the energetic impulse
of Lally, a thousand Europeans and as many French
Sepoys under Count d'Estaing arrived before Fort
St. David from Pondicherry and exchanged shots with
the garrison. On the morrow M. de Soupire joined
d'Estaing with additional troops and with siege-guns,
and on the 1st of May appeared Lally himself, who
immediately detached a force under d'Estaing against
Cuddalore. The defences of this town were slight and
the garrison consisted of five companies of Sepoys only,
which were encumbered by the custody of fifty French
prisoners. The fort accordingly capitulated on the
4th of May, on condition that the garrison should
retire to Fort St. David with its arms, and that the
French prisoners should be transported to neutral
ground in the south until the fate of Fort St. David
should be decided. Two days later d'Aché's squadron
anchored again before Fort St. David and landed the
troops from on board; and on the 15th the French
began the erection of their first battery for the siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 28.<br />June 2.</div>

<p>Lally had now the considerable force of twenty-five
hundred Europeans and about the same number
of Sepoys assembled before the town; but his difficulties
none the less were very great. The authorities
at Pondicherry were disloyal to him; the military
chest was absolutely empty; and, long though his
arrival had been expected, no preparation had been
made for his transport and supplies. In his impatience
for action, for he dreaded the return of Pocock from
Madras, he had hurried the first detachment forward
to Cuddalore without any transport or supplies whatever,
with the result that the troops had been obliged
to plunder the suburbs for food. Now, since no other
means seemed open to him, he took the still more fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
step of impressing the natives for the work of carriage,
without respect to custom, prejudice, or caste. For
the moment, however, he was successful. The defences
of Fort St. David were respectable, but the garrison was
too weak in numbers to man them properly, and the
quality of the troops was remarkably poor. The Sepoys
numbered about sixteen hundred and the Europeans
about six hundred; but of the latter less than half were
effective, while two hundred and fifty out of the whole
were sailors, recently landed from the frigates and most
defective in discipline. Major Polier, who was in
command, made the mistake of attempting to defend
several outworks with an inadequate force, instead of
destroying them and retiring into the main fortress.
Lally was therefore able to drive the defenders from
these outworks piecemeal; and his success sufficed to
scare nearly the whole of the Sepoys into desertion.
A ray of hope came for a moment to the garrison with
the news that Pocock's squadron had arrived at Pondicherry
on its way from Madras, and that the French
sailors had mutinied, refusing to put to sea until their
wages were paid. But Lally, always energetic, contrived
to find the necessary funds, and d'Aché set sail in time
to prevent any communication between the fleet and
Fort St. David. Finally the fort, though not yet
breached, capitulated on the 2nd of June, and Lally's
first great object was gained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 7.</div>

<p>The fall of Fort St. David gave great alarm at
Madras, and with reason, for the defence had been
discreditably feeble. Polier had formerly proved
himself in repeated actions to be a gallant soldier; but
making all allowance for the defects of his garrison,
his conduct was not such as was to be expected from a
countryman of Caillaud and a brother officer of Clive,
Lawrence, and Kilpatrick. Moreover, Lally was not
a man to be content with a single success. On the
very day of the surrender he detached a force under
d'Estaing against Devicotah, which was perforce
abandoned by the British at his approach; and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
was every reason to fear that his energy would now be
bent towards the capture of Madras. The government
therefore called in all its scattered garrisons in
the Carnatic, maintaining only that of Trichinopoly,
and concentrated them in Madras; thus adding two
hundred and fifty Europeans and twenty-five hundred
Sepoys to the strength of that city. On this same day
Lally returned to Pondicherry with his army from Fort
St. David and made triumphant entry. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> was
sung, and thanksgiving was followed by banquets and
festivities&mdash;all at a time when the public treasury was
empty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 18.</div>

<p>In fact, however Lally might long for it, there was
no possibility for him yet to attack Madras. D'Aché,
declaring that his duty summoned him to cruise off
the coast of Ceylon, would not spare the fleet to aid in
the enterprise against the seat of British power in the
Carnatic, and actually sailed for the south on the 4th
of June. For a march overland upon Madras Lally's
army required equipment; and equipment meant
money, which the authorities at Pondicherry averred
that they could not supply. Acting therefore on the
advice of a Jesuit priest, Lally resolved to march into
Tanjore and to extort the cash which he needed from the
Rajah. The civil authorities in alarm recalled d'Aché
to protect Pondicherry, and on the day following his
arrival Lally ordered out sixteen hundred European
troops and a still larger number of Sepoys and started
with them for the south.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 25.</div>

<p>The march was one long succession of blunders and
misfortunes. The harsh measures employed towards
the natives on the advance to Fort St. David had
alienated every man of them from taking service with
the army; so the force started without transport.
Gross excesses committed by the French troops in
plundering the country drove the villagers to hide
away all their cattle; hence neither transport nor
supplies were to be obtained on the march. The
soldiers were therefore of necessity turned loose to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
provisions as best they might, and their discipline,
already seriously impaired, went rapidly from bad to
worse. When they entered Devicotah they had not
tasted food for twelve hours; and finding that only
rice in the husk awaited them there, they set fire to the
huts within the fort and went near to kindling the
magazines. It was not until they reached Carical,
after traversing fully a hundred miles, that the troops
at last received a real meal. Fresh follies marked the
progress of the march. The town of Nagore was seized
and its ransom farmed out to the captain of the French
hussars, a corps which had only recently arrived in
India and had distinguished itself above all others by
violence and pillage. Ammunition again, for even this
was not carried with the army, was extorted by force
from the Dutch settlements of Negapatam and Tranquebar.
Finally, two pagodas of peculiar sanctity were
plundered, though to no advantage, and the Brahmins
were blown from the muzzles of guns. Lally's difficulties
were doubtless great, and his methods were those
honoured and to be honoured by his countrymen in
many a campaign past and future; but it is hard to
understand how a man calling himself a soldier could
deliberately have led from three to four thousand men
for a distance of a hundred miles from his base without
making the slightest provision for its subsistence, or the
least effort to maintain its discipline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August.<br />Aug. 18.</div>

<p>Lally's sins soon found him out. On his arrival at
Carical seven thousand Tanjorines under the Rajah's
general, Monacjee, advanced to Trivalore to oppose
him; and this force was soon afterwards swelled not
only by native allies but by five hundred British Sepoys
and ten English gunners, who had been lent by Caillaud
from Trichinopoly. Monacjee fell back before Lally
step by step to the city of Tanjore, but his cavalry
never ceased to harass the French foraging-parties, to
drive off the cattle which they had collected, and to
intercept supplies. Some days were spent in fruitless
negotiation, and on the 2nd of August Lally's batteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
opened fire on the city; whereupon Caillaud immediately
sent to the Rajah a further reinforcement of five
hundred of his best Sepoys. On the 8th disquieting
intelligence reached Lally of the defeat of a French
squadron by the British, and of a British occupation of
Carical, the only port from which his army, already
much distressed by want of stores and ammunition,
could possibly be relieved. On the 10th, having with
difficulty repelled a sortie of the garrison, he raised the
siege and retreated towards Carical, leaving three heavy
guns behind him. Instantly the Tanjorines were after
him, hovering about him on every side during his
march, swooping down on stragglers and cutting off
supplies. The sufferings of the French troops were
frightful. It was only with the greatest difficulty that
Lally brought them through to Carical, to find on his
arrival that the British fleet was anchored at the mouth
of the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 28.<br />Sept.</div>

<p>For on the 2nd of August Pocock had again engaged
d'Aché, though with inferior numbers, and after an
action of two hours had so battered the French squadron
that it had crowded all sail to escape and taken refuge
under the guns of Pondicherry. Moreover, d'Aché was
so much disheartened that he not only refused to meet
the British again, but announced his intention of returning
to Mauritius. Lally had received intimation of this
resolve during his retreat to Carical, and had despatched
Count d'Estaing to d'Aché to protest against it. On
arriving with his army at Pondicherry from Carical he
repeated his remonstrances, but in vain. D'Aché had
secured thirty thousand pounds by illegal capture of
certain Dutch ships in Pondicherry roads, and this he
was content to leave with his colleagues; but he was
resolute as to his departure from the coast, and on the
2nd of September he sailed away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 4.</div>

<p>Whatever Lally's indignation against d'Aché for
this desertion, it must be confessed that his operations
had been little more successful than the Admiral's.
He had injured both the health and the discipline of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
his troops by the raid into Tanjore, and had failed to
extract more than a trifling sum from the Rajah. The
money taken by d'Aché, however, furnished him with
sufficient funds to initiate preparations for a march on
Madras; and since the British had seized the opportunity
of his own absence to recapture some of the scattered
forts in the Carnatic, he despatched three several expeditions
to Trinomalee, Carangooly, and Trivatore to
clear the way to Arcot, ordering them to concentrate
about thirty-five miles south-east of Arcot, at Wandewash.
The several columns having done their work,
he joined the united force in person at Wandewash and
marched with it on Arcot, which having no British
garrison surrendered without resistance. There now
remained but two posts in the occupation of the British
between him and Madras, Conjeveram on the direct
road from Arcot to Madras, and Chingleput on the
river Paliar, neither of them strongly garrisoned and
both therefore easy of capture. Failing, however, to
appreciate the importance of these two forts, and finding
that his stock of ready money was exhausted, Lally sent
his troops into cantonments, and returned to Pondicherry
to collect funds. Thereby he threw away his
last chance of worsting the British in India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 14.</div>

<p>The authorities at Madras accepted his successes in
the Carnatic as the inevitable consequence of the fall
of Fort St. David, and were therefore little dismayed.
Nevertheless the situation had been apprehended to be
serious; and early in August appeal had been made to
Bengal for assistance. It was refused. Clive was not
indifferent to the peril of the sister Presidency, but he
had matured designs of his own for a diversion in favour
of the Carnatic, which, as shall presently be seen, was
brilliantly executed. Madras being thus thrown on
her own resources, the authorities resolved at the end of
August to recall Caillaud and all the European troops
from Trichinopoly, and to leave Captain Joseph Smith
in charge of that city with two thousand Sepoys only.
After some inevitable delay Caillaud embarked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
Negapatam, and on the 25th of September arrived safely
with one hundred and eighty men at Madras. A few
days before, a still more welcome reinforcement had
been received in the shape of Colonel Draper's regiment,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
eight hundred and fifty strong, with Draper himself,
lately an officer of the First Guards, in command.
Such an accession of strength made it possible to profit
by Lally's omission to capture Chingleput. That post
covered a district which, being rich in supplies, would
spare Madras the exhaustion of the stock which had
been laid up for the expected siege; and in view of its
importance the troops at Conjeveram were withdrawn
to it, and the garrison gradually strengthened to a force
of one hundred Europeans and twelve hundred Sepoys.
Further, it was determined to hire a contingent of
Mahrattas and of Tanjorines so as to harass the enemy's
convoys and lines of communication during the siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 13.</div>

<p>These preparations were well completed some time
before Lally was ready to move. That General was
indeed concentrating all the strength of France for his
great effort against Madras, but in blind pursuance of this
object he had removed the most dangerous enemy of the
British from the post in which, of all others, he would
have been most formidable. In plain words, he had
recalled Bussy, with his army, from the court of Salabad
Jung and from the administration of the Deccan.
Further, he had ordered him to entrust the occupation
of the Northern Sirkars to M. Conflans, an officer who
was only just arrived from Europe, together with the
smallest possible force that would enable him to maintain
it. Bussy obeyed, but in perplexity and despair; for
it was hard for him to abandon the work at which he
had toiled for so long with unwearied zeal and unvarying
success; and it was scarcely to be expected that he
should feel cordially towards this new and impulsive
commander who, whatever his merits, possessed not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
quarter of his own ability. Lally on his side entertained
decided antipathy towards Bussy. He looked upon the
French authorities in India generally as a pack of rogues,
wherein he was not far wrong, but in including Bussy
with the common herd he was very far from right.
He therefore treated Bussy's supplications to return to
Hyderabad as designed merely for the thwarting of his
own enterprise, and disregarded them accordingly. The
junior officers of the army, with a sounder appreciation
of Bussy's powers, generously petitioned that he might
rank as their superior, to which request Lally, though
with no very good grace, was forced to accede. Thus,
for one preliminary disadvantage, there was little prospect
of hearty accord and co-operation in the French
camp. Then there was the deficiency of funds to be
faced, which was only overcome by subscriptions from
the private purses of Lally and other officers; though
Bussy, the wealthiest of all, declined, if Lally is to be
believed, to contribute a farthing. Finally, there were
endless troubles over the matter of transport, for which
Lally had no one but himself to thank; and, what with
one embarrassment and another, it was the end of
November before the French troops were fairly on the
march for Madras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec.<br />Dec. 13.</div>

<p>Lally's force comprised in all twenty-three hundred
Europeans, both horse and foot, and five thousand
Sepoys. The main body moved from Arcot along the
direct road by Conjeveram, and a large detachment
followed the bank of the Paliar upon Chingleput.
Lally in person joined this latter column on the 4th of
December, but having reconnoitred Chingleput decided
to leave it in his rear, and to continue his march northward
to Madras. The defending force collected by the
British in that city amounted to seventeen hundred and
fifty Europeans and twenty-two hundred Sepoys, the
whole under command of Colonel Stringer Lawrence.
The Colonel drew the greater part of these troops into
the field to watch the French movements, failing back
slowly before them as they advanced; and on the 13th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
Lally's entire force encamped in the plain, rather more
than a mile to south-west of Fort St. George. Nearer
approach to the fort was barred by two rivers, the more
northerly of them, called the Triplicane, entering the
sea about a thousand yards south of the glacis; the
other, known as the North River, washing the actual
foot of the glacis, but turning from thence abruptly
southward to join the Triplicane and flow with it into
the sea. Lally therefore passed round to the other side
of Fort St. George, the British evacuating the outer posts
before him as he advanced, and established himself in the
Black Town on the north-western front of the fort, and
thence along its northern side to the sea. With his
right thus resting on the town and his left on the
beach, he prepared to open the siege of Madras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 14.</div>

<p>The Black Town was rich, and the French troops,
with the indiscipline now become habitual to them, fell
at once to indiscriminate plunder, with the result that
in a short time a great many of them were reeling drunk.
Colonel Draper thereupon proposed a sortie in force,
and the suggestion was approved as tending to raise the
spirit of the garrison. Accordingly, at eleven o'clock
on the following morning, Draper with five hundred
men and two guns marched out from the western ravelin
of the fort, and holding his course westward for some
distance turned north into the streets of the Black Town
to attack the French right, while Major Brereton with
another hundred men followed a route parallel to him,
but nearer to the fort, in order to cover his retreat. By
some mistake Draper's black drummers began to beat
the Grenadiers' March directly they entered the town,
and so gave the alarm. The French formed in a cross
street to receive the attack, but in the confusion mistook
the line of the British advance and awaited them
at the head of the wrong street, too far to the westward.
Draper therefore came up full on their left flank,
poured in a volley, and bringing up his guns opened fire
with grape. In a few minutes the whole of the French
had taken refuge in the adjoining houses, and Draper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
ordering his guns to cease fire, rushed forward to secure
four cannon which the French had brought with them.
The French officer in charge of them offered to surrender
both himself and his guns, when Draper, looking behind
him, found that he was followed by but four men, the
rest having, like the enemy, fled for shelter to the
houses. Had the British done their duty Draper's
attack would probably have put an end to the siege
then and there; but as things were, the French, hearing
the guns cease, quickly rallied, and streaming out of the
houses in superior numbers opened a destructive fire.
Draper was obliged to abandon the guns and order a
retreat, the French following after him in hot pursuit.
His position was critical, for he could not retire by the
route of his advance, but was obliged to take a road
leading to the northern face of the fort. The way was
blocked by a stagnant arm of the North River with but
one bridge; and it lay within the power of Lally's
regiment, on the left of the French position, to reach
this bridge before him and so to cut off his retreat.
Bussy, however, who was in command on the French
left, either through jealousy, or possibly because his men
were too much intoxicated to move, took no advantage
of this opportunity. Brereton came up in time to
cover Draper's retreat, and the British re-entered the
fort in safety. They had lost over two hundred men
in killed, wounded, and prisoners in this abortive attack;
and though the French had suffered as great a loss, yet
they were victorious whereas the British were demoralised.
Had Lally's regiment done its duty Madras would
probably have fallen in a few days. So ended an episode
most thoroughly discreditable to both parties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759.<br />Jan.<br />Feb.<br />Feb. 9.<br />Feb. 17.</div>

<p>Lally now began the construction of batteries over
against the north and north-western fronts of the fort,
from the Black Town to the sea. Meanwhile Caillaud
was despatched to Tanjore to obtain troops from the
Rajah; and Captain Preston, who commanded the
garrison at Chingleput, never ceased to harass the
French by constant petty attacks and threatening of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
their communications. At length, on the 2nd of
January, the French batteries opened fire, which they
continued throughout the month, but with no very
great effect. The indiscipline which Lally had permitted
during his earlier operations told heavily upon
the efficiency of the besieging force; and everything
moved slowly and with friction. At length, on the
30th of January, a British ship arrived to hearten the
garrison with ammunition and specie, both of which
were sorely needed; and on the 7th of February
Caillaud, after endless difficulties at Tanjore, joined
Preston at Chingleput and increased his force by
thirteen hundred Sepoys and two thousand Tanjorine
horse. Though half of the Sepoys and the whole of
the horse were worth little, yet this growth of numbers
in his rear, and the knowledge that Pocock's squadron
was on its way from Bombay to relieve Madras, forced
Lally to take strong measures against Chingleput.
Accordingly, on the 9th of February, he detached a
force of nine hundred Europeans, twelve hundred Sepoys
and five hundred native horse, with eight field-pieces,
to attack Caillaud in earnest. The action was hot, and
Caillaud only with the greatest difficulty succeeded in
holding his own; but ultimately the French were repulsed,
and Chingleput, that terrible thorn, remained
still rankling in Lally's side. His position was now
desperate. Supplies, money, ammunition, all were failing,
and his troops, both native and European, were
melting away by desertion. He had succeeded in
battering a breach in the fort, but his officers were
averse to attempt an assault. Finally, on the 16th the
arrival of Pocock's squadron, at once relieving Madras
and threatening Pondicherry, brought his darling project
to an end. By the morning of the 17th he was in
full march for Arcot, leaving fifty-two guns, all his
stores and ammunition, and forty sick and wounded
men behind him.</p>

<p>So ended the siege of Madras, the last offensive
movement of the French in India. It had cost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
garrison thirty-three officers, five hundred and eighty
Europeans and three hundred Sepoys killed, wounded
and prisoners, while over four hundred more of the
Sepoys had deserted. Happily Pocock's squadron
brought reinforcements which made good the loss of
Europeans. The casualties in the French army remain
unknown, but, whether they were considerable or not,
the survivors were at any rate demoralised. Lally
retired with bitter rage in his heart against the
authorities at Pondicherry, to whose apathy and self-seeking
he attributed his failure. Doubtless if they
had seconded his efforts loyally and truly, his difficulties
would have been infinitely less, and his chances of
success proportionately greater. But even if the hasty
and masterful temper which estranged them from him
be excused, nothing can palliate his two cardinal errors
as a soldier; first, the omission to secure Chingleput
while yet the capture was easy, and secondly the neglect
to enforce discipline among all ranks of his army.
Violence without strength, energy without foresight,
imperiousness without ascendency&mdash;such are not the
qualities that go to make a great leader in the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758.</div>

<p>And meanwhile the counterstroke prepared by Clive
had fallen once and was about to fall again with redoubled
force. Affairs in Bengal in the autumn of
1758 stood on no very sure footing. Meer Jaffier was
not wholly resigned to his puppet-hood; but his nobles
were disaffected, his treasury was empty, and he was
threatened on his northern frontier by invasion from
Oude; so he was obliged reluctantly to throw himself
upon the protection of Clive. So unstable a condition
of affairs presented no ideal moment for weakening the
small force on which British influence in those provinces
might depend; but Clive, perceiving that Bussy's withdrawal
from Hyderabad gave him a chance to substitute
British for French ascendency at the court of the
Deccan, determined at all hazards to seize it. The
ruler of one district of the Northern Sirkars, the Rajah
Anunderaj, had already risen in revolt against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
French, seized Vizagapatam, and appealed to Madras
for assistance. An agent was sent to concert operations
with him; and Clive, making up a force of five hundred
European infantry and artillery, one hundred Lascars
and two thousand Sepoys, together with six field-guns
and as many battering pieces, shipped them off from
Calcutta at the end of September. The command was
entrusted to Lieutenant-Colonel Forde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec.<br />Dec. 9.</div>

<p>The voyage was protracted by foul weather, and
it was not until the 20th of October that the expedition
reached Vizagapatam, from which it marched to join
Anunderaj's troops at Cossimcotah. Here more delay
was caused by the unwillingness of the Rajah to fulfil
his engagement to pay the British troops; but at length
on the 1st of December the force advanced and on the
3rd came in sight of the enemy, who were encamped
forty miles north of Rajahmundry within sight of the
fort of Peddapore and astride of the high road to
the south. The French force, which was commanded
by M. Conflans, consisted of five hundred Europeans,
six thousand Sepoys and a quantity of native levies.
Forde's army, on his side, had received the accession of
five hundred worthless horse and a rabble of five
thousand foot, chiefly armed with pikes and bows,
which represented the contingent of Anunderaj. On
the 6th Forde advanced along the high road to within
four miles of Conflans, but each officer thought the
other too strong to be attacked. Inaction continued
until the 8th, when both commanders simultaneously
framed independent designs for extricating themselves
from the deadlock. Conflans's plan was to send six
guns with a sufficient force to a height which commanded
the British camp, and which Forde had omitted
to occupy. Forde, for his part, had decided to make
a detour of three miles to Condore, from which he
could turn Conflans's position and regain the high road
to Rajahmundry. At four o'clock on the morning of
the 9th, accordingly, Forde marched away with his own
troops only, while the Rajah's army, which though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
warned was unready to move, remained in the camp.
Forde had not proceeded far before he heard the sound
of Conflans's guns in his rear and received piteous
messages from the Rajah for assistance. Turning back
he met the Rajah's rabble in full flight and rallied
them; after which the whole force pursued its march
and at eight o'clock arrived at Condore.</p>

<p>Conflans, flattering himself that he had defeated
Forde's entire army, followed him quickly, with the
idea of preventing his return to his former camp; and in
his haste to advance allowed his line to fall into disorder.
His European battalion was in his centre, with thirteen
field-pieces distributed on its flanks, while his right and
left wings were composed each of three thousand Sepoys
with some unwieldly native cannon. Forde formed
his line in much the same order. In his centre he
posted the British, now represented by the Hundred-and-First
and Hundred-and-Second Foot, with six guns
on their flanks, and his Sepoys, in two divisions each of
nine hundred men, on either wing; and he bade the
Rajah's troops keep out of the way in the rear. He
then advanced under a heavy cannonade from the
enemy for some distance before Condore, and halted
with his centre in rear of a field of Indian corn, which
entirely concealed the Europeans, but left the Sepoys
uncovered on the plain on either hand. These Sepoys,
being from Bengal, were dressed in scarlet instead of in
the white clothing worn by their brethren in the hotter
climate of the south. The French had never seen the
scarlet except on the bodies of European troops, and
Forde was fully aware of the fact; for he ordered the
Sepoys to furl the old-fashioned Company flags, which
they still carried, as also their regimental colours, that
they might be the more easily mistaken for a regular
battalion of British.</p>

<p>In the ardour of their advance the enemy's infantry
out-marched their guns and moved forward without
them. Their line, from its superiority in numbers, far
outflanked the British on both wings; but as it drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
nearer, the French battalion in the centre suddenly
inclined to the right towards Forde's left wing of Sepoys.
Conflans had swallowed the bait laid for him by Forde.
The French battalion evidently mistook the Sepoys for
Europeans, for before engaging them it dressed its
ranks, and then opened fire by platoons at a distance of
two hundred yards. Long though this range was for
the old musket, the Sepoys seeing Europeans in front
and natives menacing their flank hardly stood to deliver
a feeble volley, but immediately broke, despite all the
efforts of Forde, and fled away pursued by the enemy's
horse. Conflans at once detached several platoons of
his Europeans to join in the pursuit; when to his dismay
a second line of scarlet filed steadily up from behind
the Indian corn to the ground whereon the Sepoys had
stood, halted and fronted as coolly as if on parade, and
then with equal coolness opened fire by volleys of
divisions from the left.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The first volley brought down
half of the French grenadiers, and by the time that the
fifth and last division had pulled trigger the whole of
Conflans's European battalion was broken up, and flying
back in disorder to its guns, half a mile in rear.</p>

<p>Forde, unable to curb the eagerness of his men,
allowed them to pursue in succession of divisions, the left
leading; but every division marched too fast to preserve
order excepting the fourth, which was kept well in hand by
Captain Yorke as a rallying-point in case of mishap. But
no mishap was to come. The French rallied behind their
cannon, but had not time to fire more than a round or
two when the British fell upon them, drove them from
their batteries and captured every gun. The Sepoys and
native levies of the French made little or no stand after
the defeat of their Europeans, and the British Sepoys
of the right, together with some rallied fugitives from
the left, advanced to join their victorious comrades.
No sooner were they come than Forde made fresh dispositions,
and marched on without losing a moment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
attack Conflans's camp. The remnants of the French
battalion, which were posted in a hollow way before it,
made some faint show of resistance; but seeing the
British guns coming forward, turned to the right about
and fled, with the British in hot pursuit. Many of the
fugitives threw down their arms and surrendered; the
rest, together with the remainder of the French army, ran
away in hopeless confusion. Conflans, after sending off
his military chest and four field-guns, jumped on a horse
and galloped away, not stopping except to change horses
till he reached Rajahmundry, forty miles distant. Of
his Europeans seventy-six officers and men were killed,
many wounded, and fifty-six taken. Thirty cannon,
seven mortars, and the whole of his baggage and transport
were captured. The British loss amounted to no
more than forty Europeans and over two hundred
Sepoys killed and wounded. Had the Rajah's cavalry
been of the slightest value, the losses of the French
would have been far greater; but Forde's promptness
in following up his first success made his victory sufficiently
complete. This brilliant little action marked the
rise of yet another great leader among the British in
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 10.<br />Dec. 11.</div>

<p>The British battalion being much fatigued was halted
after the engagement in the French camp, but on the
same evening Captain Knox with the right wing of
Sepoys was sent forward to Rajahmundry. On the
following day a further reinforcement of Sepoys joined
him; and the French, still under the influence of panic,
evacuated the fort. Knox at once entered it, and turning
the guns on to the fugitives, though far out of
range, set them running once more. Thus Rajahmundry,
the gate and barrier of the district of Vizagapatam,
passed into the hands of the British, with all its artillery,
ammunition, and stores. Forde arrived there with the
rest of the army on the 11th, eager to pursue his success
by an advance on Masulipatam. This, the most
important town and the centre of French influence in
the province, was doubly important to the enemy as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
base from which they might at any time recover their
lost territory. Forde, however, was in want of money,
for which he had relied on the promises of Anunderaj.
The Rajah, as is the way of his kind, now refused either
to supply funds or to set his rabble in motion to accompany
him. At length after six weeks of negotiation
this deplorable potentate was induced, partly by favourable
terms of repayment, partly by a severe fright, to
fulfil his undertaking; but fifty precious days had been
lost, and the French had gained time to recover themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759.<br />Feb.<br />March.</div>

<p>On the 28th of January Forde resumed his march,
and on the 6th of February occupied Ellore, forty-eight
miles north of Masulipatam. Here again he was compelled
to halt by the dilatoriness of the Rajah in sending
forward supplies; but he was not on that account idle.
Conflans, having got the better of his panic after Condore,
had replaced garrisons in Narsipore and Concal,
two outlying strongholds to the north of Masulipatam,
and had organised an army of observation, consisting of
two hundred and fifty Europeans and two thousand
Sepoys, under M. du Rocher. The dispositions of this
latter force were so faulty as to leave Narsipore in isolation,
and Forde lost no time in sending Captain Knox
with a detachment of Sepoys to capture it. The French
commander of the post was no sooner warned of Knox's
approach then he evacuated Narsipore and joined the
army of du Rocher. Then came more delay; and it
was the 1st of March before Forde was again able to
move. Two days later Concal was taken, though most
gallantly defended by a French sergeant; and on the 6th
Forde came in sight of Masulipatam. Conflans occupied
a strong position before the town, which he might have
held with advantage; but his heart failed him, and he
retired within the fortifications.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March 7-25.<br />March 27.<br />April 1.</div>

<p>The defences of Masulipatam had been improved
by the French since their entry into possession in 1751,
and now formed an irregular parallelogram, open on
the south side, where a broad estuary furnished sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
natural protection, and closed on the three other
sides by mud walls faced with brick and strengthened
by eleven bastions: there was also a wet ditch and a
narrow palisaded space between ditch and parapet,
but no glacis. On the landward side the fort was
surrounded everywhere by a heavy swamp, the road
to the town being carried on a causeway to the main
gate on the north-west front. This causeway was
covered for a distance of a hundred and twenty yards
from the wall by a parapet ending in a ravelin, which
commanded the whole length of the road. The only
sound ground within reach of the fort was to be found
on some sandhills to east and west of it; of which those
on the eastern side, being within eight hundred yards
of the wall, were selected by Forde for his position.
Regular approaches for a formal siege were out of the
question for so small a force, so Forde was fain to begin
the erection of batteries on the sandhills, to play on
the works from thence as best they could. The whole
of the eighteen ensuing days were devoted to the work
of construction, the siege-guns being landed from ships
which had followed the movements of the army along
the coast. During this short period it seemed as
though fate had laid itself out to raise every possible
obstacle against Forde's success. No sooner had he
invested Masulipatam than du Rocher's army of
observation woke to sudden activity, and moved round
upon Rajahmundry and the British communications with
the north. The officer in charge of that fort, being
unable to make any defence, was obliged to send away
to safer custody a large sum in specie which had been
received from Bengal; and thus Forde's supply of
ready money was cut off. Du Rocher then advanced
a little to the northward of Rajahmundry, vowing
vengeance against Anunderaj's country, and so terrified
the pusillanimous Rajah that he declined to employ
either his money or his credit for the service of the
British army. Forde was left absolutely penniless.
He had already borrowed all the prize-money of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
officers and even of his men, and knew not whither to
turn for cash for the payment of his troops. The
soldiers became apprehensive and discontented, and on
the 19th the whole of the Europeans turned out with
their arms in open mutiny, and threatened to march
away. With great difficulty Forde persuaded them to
return; and the men, once conciliated, went back to
work with all their former ardour. But the batteries
had not been completed two days when news arrived
that the Viceroy, Salabad Jung, was arrived at the
river Kistnah, not more than forty miles away, with an
army of forty thousand men, to expel the intruders who
had dared to invade the provinces under his suzerainty.
Messengers arrived from him requiring Anunderaj to
quit the British immediately and to repair to his
standard; and the terrified Rajah actually started to
return to his own country. He was only with
difficulty recalled by Forde's representations that his
one chance of retreat was to remain with the British.
In the faint hope of gaining time Forde proposed to
open negotiations with Salabad Jung, who to his great
relief consented to receive his emissary and undertook
for the present to advance no farther. Here, therefore,
was a respite, though not such as could be counted
on for long endurance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 6.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, ever since the 25th of March, Forde's
batteries had maintained a hot fire; and, though the
damage done to the works by day had been regularly
repaired by the besieged at night, three of the bastions
had been sufficiently ruined to give foothold to a
storming party. But now the weather changed, and
on the 5th of April the southern monsoon broke with
a flood of rain that soaked the morass around the fort
to its deepest. On the morrow the storm ceased,
but the day was ushered in by the gloomiest of tidings
for Forde. Salabad Jung was advancing from the
Kistnah, and du Rocher was on the point of junction
with him. Finally, on the same evening, the artillery-officers
reported that but two days ammunition was left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
for the batteries. Here, therefore, was the climax.
Before Forde was a fortress with a garrison of greater
strength than his own army; behind him was a force
which outnumbered his own by more than ten to one;
his communications were cut, and his ammunition and
his funds were exhausted. It was open to him to
embark and retire ignominiously by sea, or to stake all
on a single desperate venture. He chose the bolder
course and resolved to storm the fort.</p>

<p>During the progress of the siege it had been
remarked that at the south-western corner of the fort,
adjoining the sound, no ditch had been constructed;
the ground without being a mere waste of mire, which
might well be accounted a more difficult obstacle than
any ditch. Natives, however, had more than once been
seen traversing this quagmire; and Captains Yorke
and Knox on making trial of it found it to be stiff and
heavy indeed, but not more than knee-deep. This,
therefore, was a point at which at least a false attack could
be made, and Forde resolved to take advantage of it.
Another point at which a feint might be directed was the
ravelin outside the main gate. The true attack must of
necessity be delivered against the front which had been
damaged by the batteries; and the north-east bastion,
known as the Chameleon, was the place selected. The
necessary dispositions were quickly settled. The Rajah's
troops were some of them to guard the camp, and the
rest to make a demonstration against the ravelin.
Captain Knox with seven hundred Sepoys was to conduct
the feint attack upon the south-west angle, and the
remainder of the troops were detailed for the true
assault on the Chameleon bastion. The Europeans,
who numbered but three hundred and forty-six, including
the gunners, and thirty sailors borrowed from
the ships, were told off into two divisions, the first under
Captain Callendar, the second under Captain Yorke;
while of the seven hundred remaining Sepoys part
formed a third division under Captain Macleane, and
the remainder a reserve under Forde himself. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
ordered that both the true and false attacks should
begin simultaneously at midnight, when the tide would
be at ebb and no more than three feet of water in the
ditch; and the last stroke of the gongs within the fort
was to be the signal for the storming parties to advance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 7.<br />April 8.</div>

<p>All through daylight of the 7th of April the
British batteries maintained a fierce fire, playing
impartially upon the three bastions of the eastern front.
At length night came to silence the guns, and at ten
o'clock the troops fell in for the assault. Knox having
the longer distance to traverse was the first to move off,
and his column presently disappeared into the darkness.
The minutes flew by, and the time came for the
advance of the European troops; but Captain Callendar,
the leader of the first division, was not to be found.
There was anxious enquiry and search, but the missing
officer could not be discovered; and at length, after a
precious half-hour had been lost, Captain Fischer took
his place and the column marched off without him.
The men were still struggling through the morass
towards the Chameleon bastion when the sound of
firing told them that Knox, punctual to a second, had
opened his false attack. Quickening their speed as
best they might, they plunged heavily on, knee-deep
in mire over the swamp, waist-deep in mud and water
through the ditch; when, just as Fischer's column
reached the palisade, a sharp fire from the breach and
from the bastions on either hand showed that they
were discovered. All the more eagerly Fischer's men
hewed and hacked at the palisade; while Yorke's
division engaged the St. John's bastion to his left and
Macleane the Small-gate bastion to his right. The
men fell fast, but presently the palisades were cleared
away, and the first division swarming up the breach
swept the French out of the Chameleon bastion.
Fischer halted for the arrival of Yorke with the second
division, and then the two officers parted, Fischer to
the right to clear the northern, and Yorke to the left
to clear the eastern face of the fort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding a field-gun with its ammunition in the
Chameleon bastion, Yorke at once trained it along the
rampart to southward, and was preparing to follow in
the same direction himself, when he observed a party
of French Sepoys advancing between the rampart and
the buildings of the town to reinforce the Chameleon
bastion. Instantly he ran down, and seizing the officer
at their head bade them lay down their arms and
surrender. Startled beyond all thought of resistance
they obeyed, and were at once sent back to the captured
bastion; while Yorke, taking the way by which they
had advanced, pressed on against the St. John's bastion.
The French guard, which had sought shelter within the
angles from the raking fire of Yorke's field-gun, fired
upon him and struck down not a few of his men,
but surrendered immediately afterwards. They too
were sent back to the Chameleon bastion, where the
Sepoys took charge of them; and Yorke pursued his
way to the next bastion to southward, named the Dutch
bastion, where the same scene was repeated and a fresh
consignment of prisoners was sent back to the custody
of the Sepoys. The François bastion, the most southerly
of all, alone remained untaken, and Yorke was eager to
prosecute his success; but now the men hung back.
The division had been not a little thinned by previous
losses and by the detachment of guards for prisoners
and for the captured bastions; and the handful of men
that remained with the Captain began to wonder where
such work was going to end. By threats and exhortations
Yorke after a time induced them to follow him;
but while passing an expense-magazine a little way
beyond the Dutch bastion, one of the men caught sight
of powder-barrels within it and cried out "A mine, a
mine." Immediately every man rushed back in panic
to the Chameleon bastion; and Yorke was left alone,
with his black drummers by his side vainly beating the
Grenadiers' March. Fortunately the guards in the
captured bastions stood fast; and Yorke returning to
the fugitives, who were on the point of leaving the fort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
stopped the panic by threatening death to the first man
who attempted to run. Rallying thirty-six men he
went back to complete his work; but the delay had
given the French in the François bastion time to train
a gun upon the line of his advance. Waiting until his
party was come within close range they fired, killed
sixteen of them outright and wounded several more,
including Yorke himself, who was brought to the
ground with a ball in each thigh. The survivors picked
him up and carried him off; but with his fall the attack
in that quarter came, for the time, to an end.</p>

<p>Fischer meanwhile had been even more successful
on the northern front. He cleared the two first bastions
without difficulty, and on reaching the third, by the
causeway, seized the gate and cut off the troops in the
ravelin from the fort. Captain Callendar, the missing
officer, suddenly appeared, no man knew from whence,
in the middle of the affair, but was instantly shot dead;
and Fischer was still pushing on, when he received
orders from Forde to halt. Conflans throughout the
attack had remained by the south front of the fort,
quite at his wits' end, and adding to the general confusion
by a succession of contradictory orders. Knox's attack
distracted him on one side, the Rajah's troops made an
unearthly din by the ravelin, and the true assault on the
eastern front fairly broke his spirits down. At the
very moment when Yorke's men were returning discomfited
from the François bastion, he sent a messenger
to Forde, offering to surrender on honourable terms.
Forde was far too shrewd to betray his own weakness.
He replied that he could hear of nothing but surrender
at discretion; and Conflans, concluding his position to
be hopeless, acceded. Five hundred Europeans and
two thousand French Sepoys laid down their arms, and
the British were masters of Masulipatam.</p>

<p>So ended this daring and marvellous adventure,
with the loss to the British of but eighty-six Europeans
and two hundred Sepoys killed and wounded. Salabad
Jung was within fifteen miles, and du Rocher even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
nearer at the time of the assault; but the victory was
sufficient to paralyse them also. The Viceroy quickly
consented to open negotiations, and though he haggled,
after the manner of his race, for a whole month, finally
concluded a treaty whereby he granted to the British
eighty miles of the coast, and engaged himself not only
never to entertain French troops again, but even to
compel such as remained to evacuate the Sirkars. Thus
not only was the district secured, but French influence
was displaced in favour of British at the court of
Hyderabad. Such were the prizes gained by the will,
resource, and resolution of one man, who had strength
to rend the toils that fate had woven about him just
when they seemed to have closed upon him for ever.</p>

    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1759.<br />March.</div>

<p class="noindent">Lally's failure before Madras could not fail to raise
British reputation and to depress that of the French;
and sundry petty chieftains who had long been wavering
in the Carnatic, now threw in their lot definitely with
the victors. Nevertheless the British success could be
but negative unless the territory adjacent to Madras were
at once recovered and protected; and to this task the
authorities wisely addressed themselves without delay.
The reinforcements which had already arrived, together
with two companies lately returned from Bengal, left
the British with a force of eleven hundred Europeans,
fifteen hundred Sepoys, and three thousand native
irregulars fit to take the field; but, owing to the difficulty
of collecting transport and supplies, the troops
were not in a position to advance until the 6th of
March. Meanwhile Lally had moved his army eastward
from Arcot to Conjeveram, whence he returned himself
to Pondicherry, leaving M. de Soupire in command with
orders not to risk a general action. On the British
side also the command had changed hands owing to the
failing health both of Draper and of Lawrence, and had
passed to Major Brereton of Draper's regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April 6.<br />April 15.</div>

<p>For fully three weeks the two hostile armies remained
in sight of each other, de Soupire waiting to be
attacked, and Brereton rightly declining to engage him
except on the open plain. The capture of Conjeveram
was important to the British, since the fort would cover
such districts as they had already regained, and so
liberate their army for service farther afield. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
length Brereton determined to dislodge de Soupire, if
possible, by threatening his communications south of
the Paliar; so marching upon Wandewash, the most
important French station between Madras and Pondicherry,
he broke ground before it as if for a formal
siege. De Soupire made no attempt to follow him, but
finding himself pressed for money and supplies left a
small garrison in Conjeveram and retired to Arcot, well
content to be able to reach it without hazard of an
action. Brereton thereupon made a forced march upon
Conjeveram, and before de Soupire was aware that he
had moved from Wandewash, had taken the fort, with
little difficulty, by storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.</div>

<p>Lally, who at the news of the siege of Wandewash
had advanced northward from Pondicherry, halted on
hearing of the capture of Conjeveram, and finally took
up a position seven miles to westward of the fortress.
There Major Monson, who had taken the command
from Brereton, thrice offered him battle; but Lally
declined, and after a few weeks withdrew from the field,
distributing his troops into cantonments at Arcot,
Covrepauk, Carangooly, and Chittapett. In truth his
army was rapidly going from bad to worse. A recent
exchange of prisoners had restored to him five hundred
French soldiers, who, having lived an idle and by no
means uncomfortable life in custody of the British for
five years, were very far from eager to resume hard
work in the field. Their discontent soon extended
itself to their comrades, and spread not the less rapidly
since all alike were irregularly paid. Indeed, the
garrisons both at Arcot and Covrepauk offered to betray
these stations to the British for money, though, their
hearts failing them at the last moment, they renounced
their bargain. But events had begun to turn steadily
against the French, while the British gathered strength
on every side. At the end of June two hundred recruits
arrived from England, and brought news that Colonel
Eyre Coote was likewise on his way to Madras with
his own battalion, one thousand strong, which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
lately raised in England. Brereton, who was once again
in command, seized the opportunity afforded by his
own strength and by French disaffection to make a
dash upon Covrepauk, which surrendered almost without
resistance. The flood-tide of British power was
crawling slowly but surely to the south.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>Meanwhile disquieting symptoms had been observed
in another quarter, from which British influence had
for some years suffered little trouble. There was intelligence
of a Dutch armament fitting out at Batavia
for the Bay of Bengal, which, although nominally
designed merely to reinforce the Dutch garrisons, could
not, from the known jealousy of the Dutch over the
British successes in Bengal, be credited with any very
friendly intentions. Admiral Pocock, who was cruising
off Pondicherry in daily expectation of a French
squadron, had already picked up transports with five
companies of Coote's regiment, and had received permission
to keep these troops to man his ships pending
the engagement, for which he waited, with Admiral
d'Aché. A sight of the Dutch fleet at Negapatam,
however, convinced him that the troops would be
needed ashore; and he accordingly sent them to Madras,
recommending that at least a part of them should be
forwarded to Bengal. It will presently be seen that
Pocock acted with admirable judgment and foresight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August.<br />Sept. 10.<br />Sept. 26.<br />Sept. 29.</div>

<p>This complication added not a little to the anxiety
of the British, though some relief was afforded by news
of Lally's continued troubles with his troops. At the
beginning of August his own regiment, which was in
garrison at Chittapett, broke into open mutiny and
marched out of the fort with the avowed intention of
joining the British. Their officers followed them, and
by promises to discharge the arrears of their pay, now
several months overdue, succeeded in conciliating most
of them; but sixty men persisted in their resolution and
deliberately carried it out. The authorities at Madras
seized the moment to order an advance on Wandewash;
but before the troops could march there came fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
important intelligence. D'Aché had arrived off the
coast and had for the third time been engaged by
Pocock; and the action though severe had ended indecisively
in the retirement of the French squadron to
Pondicherry. It was therefore uncertain what reinforcements
might have been landed for the defence of
Wandewash; besides which, as a further ground for
caution, there were uncomfortable signs of renewed
French intrigue at Hyderabad. But Brereton, knowing
that Eyre Coote must shortly arrive to take the command
from him, was burning to advance; and the
authorities had not the heart to bid him halt. Accordingly,
after some delay owing to heavy rain, Brereton
marched from Conjeveram, with fifteen hundred
European and twenty-five hundred native infantry,
besides cavalry and artillery, and, misled by false information
as to the strength of the French garrison,
attacked Wandewash with a thousand British only.
Though successful at the outset he was eventually repulsed
with a loss of two hundred men. The reverse
was unfortunate at so critical a time, but luckily was
insufficient to shake the confidence of the British troops
in themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov.</div>

<p>In any case, moreover, Lally was in no position to
take advantage of his success. D'Aché, though personally
a brave man, was so much chagrined by his third
failure that he sailed, in defiance of all protests, to
Mauritius, leaving Pocock master of the sea. His
desertion was a hard blow to Lally, for the indiscipline
of his troops was ever increasing. In despair of help
from other quarters he reverted to that from which
he had at first so hastily withdrawn, the court of
Hyderabad; though affairs there had altered greatly
since the departure of Bussy. Salabad Jung had been
won to the British cause by the storm of Masulipatam;
his brother Nizam Ali had always been Bussy's worst
enemy; but there was still a third brother, Basalut
Jung, who hated his brethren and had shown a friendly
disposition towards Pondicherry. Him Bussy now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
approached with the offer of the Nabobship of the
Carnatic, if he would join the French with a body of
native troops. The terms were agreed upon; Basalut
Jung began to advance along the Pennar; and Bussy
was on his way to him with five hundred Europeans,
when he was recalled by the outbreak of a dangerous
mutiny of the garrison which he had left behind him at
Wandewash. Turning back, he succeeded by payment
of six months' arrears in reducing the men to obedience;
but the incident was fatal to his negotiations with
Basalut Jung; and after a few days of fruitless haggling
he returned to Arcot, with no accession to his force but
a few irregular levies of horse and foot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 24.<br />Nov. 29.<br />Dec. 12.</div>

<p>Foiled in this direction Lally in despair determined
to make a diversion in the south, and sent a force of
nine hundred Europeans and a thousand Sepoys under
M. Crillon to alarm Trichinopoly, while he himself
marched northward to join Bussy at Arcot. Crillon
duly succeeded in capturing the island of Seringham,
and left a battalion of French there to keep the city
in awe; but Lally's rash division of his force between
points so distant as Arcot and Trichinopoly gave the
British an opportunity which they did not fail to grasp.
Coote with the remainder of his regiment, in all six
hundred men, had arrived at Madras, and though
compelled to send two hundred men forthwith to
Bengal, had been able to make good the deficiency
with about the same number of exchanged prisoners
who had arrived from Pondicherry. On the 21st of
November Coote arrived at the British camp at Conjeveram,
where he was joined two days later by the
newly arrived troops. He had already made up his mind
to attack Wandewash; but to conceal his intentions
he despatched one detachment under Brereton to seize
the fort of Trivatore on the road, sent another detachment
with the heavy artillery to Chingleput, and
himself marched upon Arcot. Brereton captured
Trivatore without difficulty, and advancing forthwith
upon Wandewash drove in the French outposts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
began to construct batteries. Coote thereupon joined
him instantly by forced marches; on the 29th his
batteries opened, and on the same day Wandewash
surrendered. Without delay Coote pushed on to
Carangooly, five-and-thirty miles to eastward, and
took that also after a few days of siege. Then calling
in all detachments to him, he on the 12th of December
reunited his entire force at Wandewash.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dec. 19.</div>

<p>Now Lally perceived the evil consequences of his
diversion in the south. The capture of Wandewash
and of the other posts retrieved at once any reputation
that the British might have lost by Crillon's success at
Seringham, while the possession of these forts was a
solid gain to his enemy. He therefore hastily recalled
Crillon, bidding him leave three hundred men only in
Seringham and join him with the rest of his troops at
Arcot. Meanwhile Bussy's irregular horse from that
city spread desolation on the north of the Paliar to
within twenty miles of Madras itself. The terror of
these marauding bands drove all the natives from the
open country to take refuge in the hills; and Coote,
who had moved up to within a few miles of Arcot, as
if to intercept Crillon on his march, was compelled by
lack of supplies and inclement weather to cross the
Paliar and distribute his troops into cantonments. So
ended for the present the disjointed and indecisive
operations in the Carnatic for the year 1759.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct.<br />Nov.</div>

<p>During these latter months any hope that Lally
might have built on diversion of the British forces to
Bengal by the menaces of the Dutch, had already been
dashed to the ground. The Dutch armament, so much
suspected of Pocock, had sailed to the mouth of the
Hooghly in October; and Meer Jaffier, weary of his
subjection and dependence, had gone to Calcutta to
concert with them the overthrow of the British in
Bengal. The Dutch force consisted of seven hundred
Europeans and eight hundred trained Malays on board
the fleet; while at Chinsura, their settlement on the
Hooghly, there were one hundred and fifty Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
soldiers, as well as native levies, which by Meer
Jaffier's connivance and help were daily increasing in
number. To meet this danger Clive could raise in
and about Calcutta but three hundred and thirty men
of the Hundred-and-First, and twelve hundred Sepoys;
but he was a man accustomed to face heavy odds.
Summoning to him every man that could be spared
from outlying stations, he called out the militia for
the defence of Calcutta, organised two tiny bodies of
volunteers, both horse and foot, ordered the British
ships to sail up the Hooghly, and strengthened the
batteries that commanded the river. At the beginning
of November Forde and Knox arrived fresh from the
triumph of Masulipatam, in time to furnish Clive with
two admirable commanders. To Knox was assigned
the command of the batteries, and to Forde that of the
troops in the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 24.</div>

<p>In the second week of November the Dutch
addressed a long letter of remonstrance and complaint
to Calcutta, and shortly afterwards followed it up by
seizing some small British vessels and burning the
British agent's house at Fulta; after which they
weighed anchor and stood up the river. Clive thereupon
ordered Forde to move forward by Serampore
upon Chinsura. Forde started accordingly with one
hundred of the Hundred-and-First, four hundred
Sepoys and four guns, and on the 23rd encamped in
the suburbs of Chandernagore, three miles distant
from Chinsura. The Dutch on the same evening sent
one hundred and twenty Europeans and three hundred
Sepoys from Chinsura to take up a position in the
ruins of Chandernagore and bar his further advance.
These Forde attacked and utterly defeated on the
following morning, capturing their guns and pursuing
them to the walls of Chinsura. Thus one part of the
Dutch force was disposed of, which, had it waited for
the co-operation of the troops on the river might
have placed Forde between two fires.</p>

<p>On the evening of the fight Knox joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
Colonel and raised his force to three hundred and
twenty European infantry, fifty volunteer cavalry, eight
hundred Sepoys, and one hundred native cavalry; with
which Forde faced about to deal with the rest of the
enemy. The Dutch squadron, for want of pilots, had
moved but slowly up the river, but on the 21st it anchored
just below the British batteries, and landed the troops
on the western bank, with orders to march to Chinsura;
which done, the ships dropped down the stream again
to Melancholy Point. There on the following day
Clive's armed East Indiamen under Captain Wilson
attacked them, three ships against seven, and captured
six of them on the spot, leaving only one to escape
and to fall an easy prey to two British men-of-war that
had arrived at the mouth of the river. This splendid
little action cut off the Dutch troops from their base
and ensured that any reverse must be fatal to them.
Nor was that reverse long in coming. On the same
evening Forde learned that the Dutch army would
come up with him on the morrow, and wrote to Clive
for instructions. Clive was playing whist when the
letter reached him. He put down his cards, and
without leaving the table wrote on the back of the
letter, "Dear Forde, fight them immediately. I will
send you the Order in Council to-morrow." Then
taking up his hand again, he went on with the game.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 25.</div>

<p>Accordingly early in the morning of the 25th Forde
took up a position midway between Chandernagore and
Chinsura and astride of the road that connects them.
His right rested on the village of Badara and his left on
a mango-grove, both of which he occupied; while his
front was covered by a broad, deep ravine behind which
he posted his four guns. About ten o'clock the Dutch
forces were seen approaching over the plain; and as
soon as they were within range Forde's artillery opened
fire. The Dutch advanced none the less with great
firmness, until to their dismay they found themselves
stopped by the ravine, of which they knew nothing.
The leading files perforce halted abruptly, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
rear, not understanding the cause, pushed on and threw
the whole body into confusion. Forde continued to
ply them with artillery and musketry until they wavered,
and then seized the moment to hurl his handful of
European cavalry at them. This threw them into still
greater disorder; and the native horse charging in their
turn completed the rout. The entire force of the
enemy, excepting sixty Dutchmen and two hundred and
fifty Malays, was killed, wounded, or taken; and the
Dutch settlements, humbled to the dust, sued not only
for mercy but for protection. Clive used his opportunity
so to shackle them that they could never again threaten
British supremacy in Bengal; and the Dutch in Europe,
being in alliance with England, disavowed the action of
their fleet and paid compensation for the damage that
it had done. Thus, far from diverting British troops
from the principal conflict, the Dutch expedition served
only to strengthen the foundations of British ascendency
by the ruin of a still older rival than the French. In
such fashion could Clive and Forde wrench profit out
of adversity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760.<br />Jan. 8.<br />Jan. 13.<br />Jan. 15.<br />Jan. 21.</div>

<p>The death-blow to French rivalry also was now
near at hand. On the 8th of January Crillon's force
reached Arcot; and in the evening of the 11th, after
three days of manœuvring, Lally divided his army into
two columns, and leaving Bussy with one of them at
Trivatore, made a forced march with the other upon
Conjeveram. So effectively had his Mahratta cavalry
screened his movements that Coote knew nothing of
them, until he received a message from the officer commanding
at Conjeveram itself. He at once made a
forced march to save the fort, but on arriving found
that Lally had been content with the plunder of the
town and had marched to rejoin Bussy at Trivatore.
Taking five hundred Europeans, a thousand Sepoys, and
six hundred and fifty French and Mahratta horse, Lally
left Trivatore on the 14th and marched on Wandewash,
which had been his true object from the first. Coote
received intelligence of his departure on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
evening, and on the following day marched also by the
direct road to the same point. Lally meanwhile, anxious
to recapture the post before Coote's arrival, had in the
morning of the 15th attacked a small British detachment
in the southern suburb and driven it with some
difficulty into the fort; after which he began to erect
batteries against the walls. On the 17th he learned
from Bussy that Coote was advancing against him; by
which time the British had actually arrived at Outramalore,
about fifteen miles to north-east of Wandewash.
Here Coote halted, being secure of his communications
with Chingleput and Madras, and resolved not to risk
an action until the French were ready to assault the
fort. The French works meanwhile progressed but
slowly; and it was not until the 20th that the batteries
opened fire, Bussy's column having meanwhile joined
Lally from Trivatore. On the next day Coote advanced
to within seven miles of Wandewash, and on the 22nd,
having directed that the rest of the army should immediately
follow him, he went forward at sunrise with
his cavalry to reconnoitre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 22.</div>

<p>About seven o'clock Coote's advanced guard struck
against an advanced party of Lally's native horse; and
presently three thousand Mahratta cavalry came swarming
over the plain in his front. Coote brought up a
couple of guns masked behind his own cavalry, and
wheeling his squadrons outwards, right and left, when
within close range, opened a fire which sent the Mahrattas
flying back with heavy loss. Then halting the main
body of his army he went forward to examine the
French camp. He found it marked out in two lines
about two miles to the east of the fort and facing eastward,
the left flank of each line being covered by a
large tank. In advance of their left front <ins class="corr" title="Errata&mdash; Original text: 'was another smaller tank which'">were two smaller tanks,
of which the foremost</ins> had been turned into an entrenchment
and armed with cannon, so as to enfilade the
whole front of the camp and command the plain beyond
it. Leaving the advanced guard halted where it stood,
he returned and brought up his main army, formed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
two lines, in order of battle before the camp. Finding
after a short halt that no notice was taken by Lally, he
caused the whole force to file to its right across the
French front towards the foot of a mountain, which
stood about two miles to northward of the fort. As soon
as the leading files had reached some stony ground,
impassable by cavalry, close to the mountain's base,
Coote again halted and fronted, at a distance of about
a mile and a half from the enemy. Seeing that this
movement also passed unnoticed, he ordered the army
to file along the skirt of the mountain round the French
left flank. By thus coasting the hill until he came
opposite to the fort he would be able to form his line
with his left resting on the mountain and his right
covered by the fire of the fort, thus at once securing
communications with the garrison and threatening the
French flank and rear.</p>

<p>Before this masterly manœuvre could be fully
completed, Lally came hurriedly out of his camp; and
presently the whole of the French army was observed
to be in motion. Coote thereupon desisted from his
movement round their left flank, halted his filing
columns, and fronting them to the left, formed his line
of battle obliquely to the enemy. Lally was thus compelled
to cancel his preconcerted dispositions, to change
front from east to north-east, and, while still resting
his left on the entrenched tank, to move forward his
right in order to bring his line parallel to that of the
British.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> None the less this tank remained the pivot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
of his position. His army was formed in a single line
in the following order. On the extreme right were
three hundred European cavalry; next to them stood
Regiment Lorraine, four hundred strong; next to
Lorraine the European Regiment of India formed the
centre; and to the left of the centre stood Regiment
Lally with its left flank resting on the entrenched tank,
the entrenchment itself being manned by marines, with
four guns. Three guns were also posted between the
tank and Lally's regiment, and as many more in the
intervals between the different corps of the line, making
sixteen guns in all. The smaller tank, which by the
change of disposition was now in rear of the entrenched
tank, was held by four hundred native infantry; while
nine hundred Sepoys were ranged on a ridge before
the camp. The total force drawn out for the action
amounted to twenty-two hundred and fifty Europeans,<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
cavalry and infantry, and thirteen hundred Sepoys;
some five hundred men more of both nationalities being
left in the batteries before Wandewash. The Mahratta
horse, having tasted the fire of the British artillery
earlier in the day, had no relish for further share in the
action.</p>

<p>Coote's army was drawn up in three lines. The
first line was composed of four European battalions,
with a battalion of nine hundred Sepoys on either flank.
Of the Europeans, Draper's regiment held the right;
the Hundred-and-Second, in two weak battalions, the
centre; and Coote's the left. Three field-guns were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
posted in the intervals on each flank of Draper's and of
Coote's, and two more with an escort of two companies
of Sepoys were detached a little in advance of the left
of the first line. The second line was made up of three
hundred European grenadiers in the centre, with a fieldpiece
and a body of two hundred Sepoys on each flank.
The third line consisted entirely of cavalry, eighty
Europeans forming the centre, with natives on either
flank. The total force in the field was nineteen
hundred and eighty Europeans, twenty-one hundred
Sepoys, and twelve hundred and fifty native horse, with
sixteen guns.</p>

<p>In this order the British advanced; but before they
arrived within cannon-shot Lally caught up his squadron
of European hussars, and making a wide sweep over the
plain came down with it upon the cavalry in the British
third line. Coote's native cavalry at once broke and
fled away, and the left divisions of Sepoys, while changing
front to meet the attack, showed signs of wavering;
but the weak squadron of British horse stood firm, and
the two detached guns of the left front under Captain
Barker coming into action at short range in the nick of
time, brought down ten or fifteen men and horses at
their first fire. The French horse thereupon broke
despite all Lally's efforts to stop them, and would not
be rallied until they had galloped far to the rear.
During this attack the British halted, while the French
batteries fired wildly and unsteadily with grape, though
their enemy was not yet within range of round shot.
Coote coolly continued his advance until his guns could
play effectively, and then opened a most destructive
fire. Lally finding his men impatient under the punishment
placed himself at their head, and gave the word to
move forward. Coote thereupon halted the whole of
his force excepting the Europeans of the first and second
lines, and advanced to meet him with these alone.
Like Forde at Condore he staked everything on the
defeat of the French regular troops.</p>

<p>Coote, true to the English rule, intended to reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
his volley for close range; but some few Africans who
were mingled in the ranks of the British opened fire
without command, and this disorder was only with
difficulty prevented from spreading to the whole line.
Coote, galloping from right to left of the line, actually
received two or three bullets through his clothes. Order
being restored, he took up his station on the left by
his own regiment; and at about one o'clock the fire of
musketry became general. Coote's regiment had fired
but two rounds, when Lally formed Regiment Lorraine
on the French right into a column of twelve men abreast,
and ordered it to charge with the bayonet. Anticipating
Wellington's tactics of a later day Coote met column
with line, reserved his fire until the French were within
fifty yards, and then poured in a volley which tore the
front and flanks of Lorraine to tatters. None the less
the gallant Frenchmen, unchecked by their losses,
pressed on the faster; and in another minute the two
regiments had closed and were fighting furiously hand
to hand. The column broke by sheer weight through
the small fragment of line opposed to it; but the
remainder of Coote's closed instantly upon its flanks;
and after a short struggle Lorraine, already much
shattered by the volley, broke up in confusion and ran
back to the camp, with the British in hot pursuit, carrying
dismay into the ranks of the Sepoys. Coote paused
only to order his regiment to be reformed, and galloped
away to see how things fared with Draper on the right.</p>

<p>As he passed, a flash and a dense cloud of smoke
shot up from the entrenched tank, followed by a
roar which rose loud above the din of battle. A lucky
shot from the British guns had blown up a tumbril
of French ammunition. The commander of the
entrenchment was killed, eighty of his men were slain
or disabled around him, and the rest of his force,
abandoning the guns, fled in panic to the French right,
followed by the Sepoys from the smaller tank in
rear. Coote instantly ordered Draper's regiment to
advance and occupy the entrenchment; but Bussy, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
commanded on the French left, brought forward Lally's
regiment to threaten their flank as they advanced, and
forced them to fetch a compass and file away to their
right. Bussy thus gained time to rally some of the
fugitives and to re-occupy the tank with a couple of
platoons; but Draper's men, with Major Brereton at
their head, moved too fast to allow him to complete
his dispositions, and coming down impetuously upon
the north face of the tank swept the French headlong
out of it. Brereton fell mortally wounded in the
attack, but bade his men leave him and push on. The
leading files hurried round to the southern face of the
tank, opened fire on the gunners posted between Lally's
regiment and the parapet, and drove them from their
guns; while the rest hurriedly formed up on their left
to resist any attempt upon the eastern face. Bussy
did all that a gallant man could do, but the odds were
too great for him; and he could hope for no help, since
all the rest of the line was hotly engaged. He wheeled
Lally's regiment round at right angles to the line to
meet the fire on its flank, and detached a couple of
platoons from his left against the western face of the
tank; but his men shrank from the British fire and
would not come to close quarters. Then two of
Draper's guns came up, and opening on the right flank
of Lally's regiment raked it through and through.
As a last chance Bussy placed himself at the head of
his wavering troops and led them straight at the
southern face of the tank; but his horse was shot under
him, and on looking round he saw but twenty men
following him, the rest having no heart for the conflict.
Two platoons of Draper's at once doubled round to
cut them off, while Major Monson came up with part
of the grenadiers of the second line to support Draper's
attack. Bussy and his devoted little band were surrounded
and made prisoners, and the whole of Lally's
regiment was captured or dispersed.</p>

<p>The battalions of the centre on both sides had
throughout kept up a continual fire at long range;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
but when the French Regiment of India perceived
both its flanks to be uncovered, it faced about and
retreated, hastily indeed but in good order. Lally
had some time before attempted to bring forward the
Sepoys from the ridge, but they had refused to move;
and the Mahrattas took themselves off when they saw
how the day was going. Nothing was left to Lally
but his few squadrons of French horse, which came
forward nobly to save his army. A few men of
Regiment Lorraine, heartened by their appearance,
harnessed the teams to three field-guns and joined
with the cavalry in covering the retreat. The British
squadron was too weak to attack, and Coote's native
horse refused to face the French cavalry; so Lally was
able to set fire to his camp, collect the men from his
batteries, and to retire in better order than his officers
had dared to hope.</p>

<p>None the less the victory was sufficiently complete.
Two hundred of the Frenchmen lay dead on the field,
as many more were wounded, and one hundred and
sixty were taken, so that Lally's loss amounted to close
on six hundred Europeans. Besides this, twenty-four
guns were taken, together with all the tents, stores,
and baggage that remained unburnt. Against this the
British had lost but sixty-three killed and one hundred
and twenty-four wounded, Draper's being the regiment
that suffered most severely. The native troops had
few casualties, for practically none but Europeans were
engaged. The speedy defeat of the French was doubtless
due to the explosion which gave away the key
of their position; and there can be no question but that
this fortunate accident immensely simplified Coote's task
for him. On the other hand, it may be asked why,
seeing that this tank was the key of the position, Lally
should have garrisoned it with sailors and marines,
the worst instead of the best of his troops. It is
improbable that, even without this stroke of luck, the
ultimate issue of the action could have been different,
especially if Lally's own figures as to the strength of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
his own force be accepted as correct. It is plain that
he felt no great confidence in his troops, and that his
distrust was justified. His cavalry would not stand
by him in his first attack on Coote's rear; his artillery
was unsteady; he did not venture to attack the British
infantry except with column against line; he seems to
have advanced in the first instance chiefly because his
men chafed under the fire of the British artillery; and
his attack on Coote's left was not only a failure in
itself but took all the heart out of his Sepoys. Coote,
on the other hand, felt perfect reliance on his troops,
and proved it by advancing finally with his infantry
only, leaving his guns to follow as they could. Moreover,
he had the choicest of his troops, the grenadiers,
still in reserve at the close of the action; so that it
would have been open to him, after the defeat of
Lorraine, to have turned these or his own regiment
upon the flank of the French battalions in the centre,
and to have rolled up their line from right to left
instead of from left to right. In fact, from the
moment that he forced Lally to come out and fight,
the superiority of his troops assured him of victory;
and it is probable that Lally himself was painfully
aware of the fact. The tragic fate of the French
commander a few years later made him an object of
compassion to foe and friend, but it is plain that the
disaster of Wandewash was principally of his own
making. Bussy had begged him to desist from the
siege on Coote's approach, but he would not, and was
therefore unable to oppose his full strength to his
enemy. Finally, though he wished to decline any
engagement except a direct attack on his camp, he
was out-manœuvred and compelled to fight on his
adversary's terms. In the face of such facts, whatever
our sympathy with a gallant and unfortunate man, it
is idle to ascribe his defeat to mere accident, although
that defeat was a mortal blow to French domination in
India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 29.<br />Feb. 9.<br />Feb. 29.<br />April 5.</div>

<p>Lally on the next day fell back to Chittapett, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
sending the Mahrattas and native troops to Arcot
retired to Gingee to cover Pondicherry. Coote on
learning of his withdrawal from Chittapett determined
to attack that post, while yet he might, with his whole
army; and after a few hours' cannonade compelled it to
surrender. Then instead of following Lally up further,
he bent himself, after the fashion of Amherst, to
systematic reduction of all the minor posts held by
the French. Arcot, the first object chosen, fell after
a siege of a few days; Timery, a few miles to south-east
of Arcot, fell at the same time; Trinomalee
surrendered on the last day of February; Permacoil
and Alumparva were taken after some resistance early
in March. Coote, however, was wounded at Permacoil;
and the capture of Carical, the one French station
left on the coast, was entrusted to Major Monson, who
speedily effected it with the help of Admiral Cornish's
squadron, which had arrived on the coast six weeks
before. The possession of Carical was of importance,
since, being an outlet from the rich country of Tanjore,
it could have kept Pondicherry supplied with provisions;
while it was also a port wherein a French squadron
could obtain not only victuals but also intelligence
before proceeding to Pondicherry. Lally, amid all his
preparations for defence, in his heart gave up the
capital for lost after its fall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 17.<br />August.</div>

<p>On the 7th of April Coote re-assumed command,
and drawing a chain of posts around Pondicherry from
Alumparva to Chillumbrum, closed in slowly upon the
doomed city. Lally had allowed him to capture far too
many of his men piecemeal in different garrisons; but
he now called in all French troops from Trichinopoly
and other posts in the south, and entered into an
agreement with Hyder Ali, then commander of the
forces at Mysore, engaging to concede large tracts of
territory in return for the services of eight thousand
men. This accession of strength to the enemy
hampered Coote not a little for the moment, the more
so since a detachment which he sent to check the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
advance of the Mysoreans was totally defeated. But
the relief to Lally was short-lived; for dearth of provisions
and unwillingness to be attached to the losing
side soon caused his new allies to withdraw. Even so,
however, the British force was not strong enough to
undertake a regular siege of Pondicherry, and Coote
was obliged to content himself with a mere blockade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 2.<br />Sept. 4.<br />1761.<br />April 5.</div>

<p>At length reinforcements arrived for the Company's
troops, together with half a regiment of Morris's
Highlanders<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> under Major Hector Munro. Three
men-of-war also came with the transports, raising the
squadron before Pondicherry to seventeen sail. Lally,
rightly guessing that more vigorous operations would
follow on this increase of the British force, devised a
plan of extreme skill and daring for the surprise of
their camp; but fortune was as usual against him. His
combinations miscarried; and his troops after showing
conspicuous gallantry were repulsed. From that day
the end drew rapidly near. Coote indeed forsook the
siege for a time on finding that Colonel Monson had
been promoted over his head, but was soon obliged to
take command again on the disabling of Monson by a
wound. It would be of no profit to linger over the
dying agony of Pondicherry. Lally, despite shameful
disloyalty and opposition from the civil authorities,
resolved to fight on to the end, trusting that d'Aché
might come with his squadron to his relief; and his
regular troops worked for him with a fidelity and
devotion worthy of the best traditions of France.
Once there came a gleam of hope. On the last day of
1760 a sudden hurricane burst over the city and
harbour which overwhelmed three of the British ships
with all hands on board, drove three more of them
ashore, and ruined all the works of the besiegers. But
the surviving ships returned within a week to resume
the blockade, and no d'Aché arrived to interrupt them.
The British works were repaired and pushed forward;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
and on the 15th of January the garrison, being on the
brink of starvation, surrendered. A few weeks sufficed
to reduce the few isolated fortresses which were still
held by French garrisons; and on the 5th of April the
white flag of the Bourbons had ceased to fly in India.</p>

<p>So after fifteen years of strange vicissitude ended
the long struggle of French and English for empire in
the East. That the result was due as much to the
shortcomings of the French Government as to the
prowess of her adversary is unquestionable; for the
corruption and mismanagement both at Versailles and
at Pondicherry were sufficient to wreck any empire.
Still the failure of the French was due to something
more than mere maladministration. Though no people
is so patriotic where the soil of their own country is at
stake, Frenchmen once passed across the sea appear to
be cursed with a fatal tendency to jealousy, distrust,
and disunion. In Canada as in India the same forces
were always at work to undermine French influence
and neutralise French success. Individual Frenchmen
are found wielding vast power and authority with
consummate ability; yet such men are always alone;
not one of them can command the loyal service of his
countrymen. Even Dupleix, the Napoleon of India,
was thwarted at every turn by his subordinates; for
Bussy may be considered to have held practically an
independent command. Again, setting aside individuals
of brilliant talent, the general average of capacity was
lower on the French side. It may have been that
ability was by some strange coincidence absent; or that
commanders had no power or were too jealous to select
the ablest of their subordinates for important work;
or indeed that capable subalterns found the acceptance
of a great trust too thankless at the hands of such
superiors. In any case the result remains the same.
There are Dupleix, Bussy, and Paradis on one side, and
on the other Clive, Saunders, Lawrence, Forde, Coote,
Brereton, Caillaud, Kilpatrick, Knox,&mdash;captains, lieutenants
and ensigns innumerable, all prepared to accept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
independent command and yet to work loyally for the
common cause. Before long there will have to be told
a story of administrative cupidity and corruption in
Calcutta as shameful as ever disgraced Pondicherry;
and yet always young officers come forward to undertake
the most perilous work and to carry it to a successful
end. Such a contrast points to a distinction between
the two nations which is more deeply rooted than in
mere accidents of administration. Partly no doubt the
victory of the British was due to the traditions that
kept archer and man-at-arms together at Crecy, and
may be ascribed to peculiarities of social and political
organisation. But beyond this there appears to be
something in the national character which makes it
difficult for a Frenchman, outside the borders of
France, to assume high station without dangerous
exaggeration of his self-esteem; while the Briton, for
all his energetic and imperious nature, has the grim
humour and the deep melancholy of his kind, ever
whispering to him of the vanity of great place.</p>

    </div>

<p class="noindent">For convenience of arrangement I have followed the
conquests both of Canada and of India without interruption
to their close. In the earlier stages of the war,
when England had not yet succeeded in obtaining for
herself the minister that she desired, it was possible and
in the fitness of narrative to turn from enterprise to
enterprise, fitfully undertaken, insufficiently provided
for, and committed to the wrong hands for execution;
since all were symptoms of one organic disorder. While
the heart of England beat weak, palpitating and intermittent,
it could not but fail to drive the blood to the
extremities, and leave them cold and paralysed. But
when, under the treatment of Pitt, the heart revives and
throbs with strength and regularity, then we can watch
member after member tingling with new life and waking
to new power; and the action of each may be traced independently,
for while their energy continues, it is certain
that the heart must be vigorous and sound. Since, however,
that work is now done, it behoves us to return, after
long digression, to England and to Pitt, and to take up
the study where it was laid down, in the spring of 1759.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759.</div>

<p>With the mighty enterprises, even now not yet
wholly told, of that year in memory, it is remarkable to
note that the estimates for 1759 showed little sign of
what was to come. The British Establishment was set
down at but eighty-five thousand men, or one thousand
more than in the previous year; and the fact is the more
extraordinary in that, ever since the previous winter, the
French had been preparing for an invasion of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Britain at three different points with sixty-three thousand
men. Vast numbers of flat-bottomed boats had been
collected at Dunkirk, Brest and Havre de Grace; and
the menace was serious, for the regular troops left in
England were but few, and the country was crowded
with French prisoners. Pitt, while reposing his chief
trust in the navy, was sufficiently disquieted in January
to offer special terms to recruits who would enlist for
short service within the kingdom only; and in May he
called out the newly-embodied militia. Yet only two
new regiments of regulars were raised during the first
half of the year. The first of these, Eyre Coote's, has
already been seen at Wandewash; the second demands
lengthier notice since it signified a new departure.
Mention has already been made of the addition of light
troops to certain regiments of cavalry: it was now
determined to form a complete regiment of Light
Dragoons; which service was entrusted to Colonel
George Augustus Elliott,<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> an officer who was to become
famous for his defence of Gibraltar, though not before
his regiment had already won fame both for him and for
itself. Its actions will come before us very soon, so
for the present it will suffice to say that Elliott's Light
Dragoons are still with us, retaining the original number
of their precedence, as the Fifteenth Hussars.</p>

<p>Such additions were trifling enough if in view of no
more than the danger of invasion, but, seeing that Pitt
abated not one jot of his aggressive designs, they were
of astonishing insignificance. With the nature and
extent of those designs the reader has already been
in great part acquainted; but it will be convenient
to recall the military situation in all parts of the
world in the spring of 1759. Goree had already
surrendered and was occupied by a British garrison;
Barrington was busy over the conquest of Guadaloupe;
in America Amherst was organising his expedition against
Ticonderoga and Crown Point, Forbes was struggling
with the first difficulties of his advance to Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Duquêsne, and Wolfe was on his way to Quebec; in India
Lally had lately raised the siege of Madras and liberated
the garrison for work in the field, Forde had lately
fought Condore and was advancing on Masulipatam,
and Clive was at Moorshedabad securing the fruits of
his victory at Plassey. Lastly, ten thousand British
troops were about to enter on their first campaign
under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. Yet it never
occurred to Pitt to recall one man of them, notwithstanding
the peril of invasion. It may be asked why
the ten thousand, being so near home, were not
summoned from Germany, and of what possible service
they could have been on the Continent. The answer,
which has already been hinted at, will occur readily to
those who have had the patience to follow me so far,
who have seen Guadeloupe worried into submission
by a handful of sickly troops, and watched Montreal
and Pondicherry drop at last into British hands like fruit
ripe for the plucking. Pitt spoke but half the truth
when he spoke of conquering America in Germany; it
was not only America, but the East and West Indies,
in a word the British Empire. The war in Germany
was in fact nothing more than a diversion on a
grand scale, and it is as such that it must now be
followed. The French likewise pursued their idea of a
diversion when they threatened a descent upon the
shores of Great Britain. It was a plan which they had
employed with some success in the days of King William
and of Queen Anne, but it had not saved them from
Marlborough at Oudenarde, and it was not to deliver
them from the busy designs of Pitt.</p>

<p>Before entering on the campaigns of Prince Ferdinand
it is indispensable to attempt to grasp the general
purport of the operations on either side. The French
had invaded Germany primarily to take vengeance upon
Prussia for King Frederick's scornful treatment of
Madame de Pompadour. Frederick, being already
occupied with the Saxons and Austrians to the south
and with the Russians on his flank to the eastward, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
hardly have escaped disaster with the French pressing on
his other flank from the west. He had indeed, in 1758,
with the swiftness that characterised his operations,
made a dash upon the French and hurled them back at
Rossbach, and within a month dealt the Austrians as
severe a buffet at Leuthen with the same army. But to
defeat two armies at two points over two hundred miles
apart within a few weeks, was a strain that could not
be repeated; and it was primarily to guard Frederick's
right or western flank that Ferdinand's army was called
into being. So far as Frederick was concerned it quite
fulfilled its purpose; but in the eyes of England its
mission was somewhat different. Under the Duke of
Cumberland the force had been called an army of
observation, to secure the frontiers of Hanover; and
Cumberland, despite Frederick's warnings, had endeavoured
to cover Hanover by holding the line of the
Weser, with results that were seen at Hastenbeck.
Under Ferdinand the army became an Allied Army for
active operations in concert with King Frederick;<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> but
none the less its chief function was to cover Hanover,
Hesse-Cassel, and Brunswick. For the French army,
being lax in discipline, behaved with shameful inhumanity
towards the inhabitants of German territory during this
war; and there was always apprehension lest the rulers
of Hesse and Brunswick, from sheer compassion towards
their suffering people, should withdraw from the Alliance.</p>

<p>Throughout the operations about to come under
our notice the French acted with at least two armies,
jointly superior to Ferdinand's in numbers, along two
different lines. The northern army was known as the
Army of the Rhine, its base being Wesel on the Lower
Rhine, an outlying possession of King Frederick's,
which had perforce been abandoned by him at the
opening of the war, and which despite Ferdinand's efforts
could never be recovered. This army was destined to
advance into Westphalia, and thence, if possible, into
Hanover; and a glance at the map will show that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
simplest line of advance was by the river Lippe. The
second or southern army of the French was known as
the Army of the Main; having provided itself with a
base on that river by the treacherous capture of Frankfort.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
This was one of the many unscrupulous actions
whereby the French made themselves loathed in Europe;
for Frankfort being an Imperial Free Town was held
always to be neutral. Still the thing was done; and
thereby was secured to the Army of the Main, which
had begun life as the Army of the Upper Rhine, not
only an excellent base but a sure means of retreat. For
the Allies, even if they defeated it, could not bar its
way to the Rhine until Frankfort should be first
besieged and captured, which could not but be a very
arduous undertaking. The primary function of this
second army was the invasion of Hesse.</p>

<p>Ferdinand's task, with an inferior force, was in its
essence defensive. For him the supremely important
thing was to retain possession of the line of the Weser,
on which waterway he depended for his supplies alike
from Germany and from England. Thus, roughly
speaking, the field of operations lay between the Rhine
on the one side and the Weser on the other, with the
sea and the Main for northern and southern boundaries;
and the normal front of the French would be to the
east and of the Allies to the west. But it must be
remembered that in addition to the army operating
from Wesel against Ferdinand's front there was
another operating from Frankfort upon his left or
southern flank; while there was always the further
danger that the Saxons might elude a Prussian corps
of observation, which was posted to check them, on the
south-east, and steal in upon Ferdinand's left rear. To
defeat these combinations it was of vital importance to
Ferdinand to hold in particular two fortresses&mdash;Münster
in Westphalia, since the French, if they took it, could
push on unhindered to the Weser and cut off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
supplies; and Lippstadt on the Upper Lippe, which
secured communications between Münster and Cassel,
or in other words between Westphalia and Hesse, and
contrariwise impeded the joint action of the two French
armies. For the rest it will be useful to take note of
three rivers which barred the advance of the French
northward from Frankfort to Cassel and beyond:
namely, counting from south to north, the Ohm, the
Eder, and the Diemel. With the last in particular, as
the final barrier between Hesse and Westphalia, we shall
have much to do; so the reader would do well to grasp
its position once for all, not neglecting its relation to
the neighbouring waters of the Lippe and the Weser.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of March.<br />April 13.</div>

<p>At the close of the campaign of 1758 Ferdinand's
winter quarters extended from Coesfeld, a little to
westward of Münster, through Münster, Lippstadt and
Paderborn to the Diemel, his front facing thus somewhat
to south of south-east. The French army of the Rhine
under Marshal Contades was cantoned along that river
from Wesel southward almost to Coblentz; while the
army of the Main, under the Prince of Soubise, the
defeated General of Rossbach, lay just to north of the
river about Frankfort. Ferdinand's first trouble was
with an advance of the Austrians upon his left flank by
the river Werra. This he headed back by a rapid
march to Fulda; and, being freed from this danger, he
resolved to turn this enforced movement to southward
to account by making a bold stroke upon Frankfort, so
as, if possible, to paralyse the operations of the French
on that side by snatching from them their base. Unfortunately
for him, the incapable Soubise had been recalled
to command the army for invasion of England,
and Marshal Broglie, who had succeeded him, had
entrenched himself in a strong position at Bergen, a
little to the north of Frankfort. There on the 13th
of April, just five days after the storm of Masulipatam,
Ferdinand boldly attacked him,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> but was repulsed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
a loss of over two thousand men, and compelled to
fall back to Ziegenhain, on the road to Cassel. His
audacious attempt to cripple one French army, before
the campaign had even been opened, had failed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May.<br />May 27.<br />May 29.</div>

<p>After this alarm the French employed themselves
busily in entrenching themselves on the Main. Prince
Henry of Prussia, by King Frederick's direction, marched
northward to relieve Ferdinand from further trouble
from the Austrians; and the enemy made little movement
during the ensuing month. On the 25th of April
Contades arrived at Düsseldorf from Paris with an
approved plan of campaign in his pocket, and proceeded
to distribute the army of the Rhine into four corps,
two of them about Wesel, a third at Düsseldorf, and a
fourth about Cologne. This grouping, as Contades
intended, left Ferdinand in doubt whether his main
design was aimed at Westphalia or Hesse. The corps
which guarded Westphalia included the British contingent
under Lord George Sackville, who had been
appointed to the command on the death of the Duke of
Marlborough in the previous year, and it lay a little to
the west of Münster, under the orders of the Hanoverian
General von Spörcke. That officer growing uneasy
over Contades's movements, Ferdinand on the 16th of
May marched from Ziegenhain, leaving sixteen thousand
men under General von Imhoff to protect Hesse, and
on the 24th, having effected his junction with Spörcke,
cantoned his troops along the Lippe from Coesfeld to
Hamm. Meanwhile Contades, detaching a corps of
fifteen thousand men under Count d'Armentières to
threaten Münster, marched southward from Düsseldorf
upon Giessen, there to join Broglie and begin operations
against Hesse. Ferdinand, in the faint hope of recalling
him to the Rhine, despatched a corps under the
Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, a most brilliant officer,
to alarm the French garrisons at Düsseldorf and other
points on the river; but Contades, adhering to his
purpose, pushed forward an advanced corps under M.
de Noailles from Giessen to Marburg, evidently intent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
on prosecuting his march to the north. Contades was
in overwhelming force. Noailles's corps at Marburg
numbered twenty thousand men, his own at Giessen
close on sixty thousand, while Broglie's reserve-corps at
Friedberg, a little to the south of Giessen, included
close on twenty thousand more. He now sent Broglie
forward by Fritzlar upon Cassel, while he himself continued
his march due north through Waldeck upon
Corbach. Imhoff, fearful of being cut off and unable
to defend Cassel, fell back towards Lippstadt; and
Broglie having left a force to occupy Cassel, turned
westward to rejoin Contades. On the 14th of June
the whole were again assembled together, Contades'
corps lying a little to the south of Paderborn, and
Broglie's at Stadtbergen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 11.<br />June 18.</div>

<p>These movements caused Ferdinand the deepest
anxiety. On the 11th of June he concentrated and
marched eastward to Büren, where he halted and picked
up Imhoff's corps; but even so he was weaker than
the enemy, for though he had recalled the Hereditary
Prince from Düsseldorf, he had been obliged to
leave nine thousand men under General Wangenheim
at Dülmen, to watch d'Armentières's designs against
Münster. But worse was to come; for on the 18th
Broglie's corps, moving up to the right of Contades's,
began to edge Ferdinand's left wing back to the westward.
Ferdinand, accepting the inevitable, fell back
on Lippstadt and crossed the Lippe to Rietberg. His
embarrassment was now extreme. He could not divine
whether the enemy designed to besiege Lippstadt or
Münster or both, or whether they meant to force a
battle upon him against greatly superior numbers. He
was inclined to risk a battle, seeing that, for all that he
could do to prevent it, both fortresses might be taken
before his eyes; in which case he must needs cross to the
east side of the Weser. So critical did he consider the
position that he wrote to King George the Second for
instructions, and begged that ships might be ready to
transport the garrison in case it should be necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
to evacuate Emden. The King's answer showed the
Guelphic loyalty and courage at its noblest. He said
that since Ferdinand was inclined to hazard an action
he also was ready to take the risk, but that he left his
General an absolutely free hand, only assuring him that
his confidence in him would be unabated, whatever the
result; and, lest Ferdinand should be in any doubt, he
caused a second letter to be written to him to the same
effect, but in stronger terms even than the first.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">June 29.<br />July 3.<br />July 8.<br />July 10.<br />July 14.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Contades marched up to Paderborn and
halted for some days, keeping Ferdinand still in doubt
as to his intentions. At last on the 29th he moved
northward and pushed his light troops forward to
Bielefeld, showing plainly that his true aim was the
capture either of Hameln or of Minden on the Weser.
Ferdinand therefore recalled Wangenheim's corps from
Dülmen to the main army; whereupon, as he had
expected, d'Armentières at once advanced to besiege
Münster. On the same day Ferdinand himself moved
northward and encamped parallel to Contades at Diessen,
comforting himself with the reflection that though his
enemies might be nearer to Minden than he, he at any
rate was nearer to his food-supplies than they.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> It was,
however, extremely difficult for him to obtain intelligence
of the French movements, since the two armies were
separated by a broad chain of wooded hills; and he
consequently hesitated for some days before he decided,
on false information of a French advance, to move
towards Osnabrück. His intention was to turn eastward
from thence, and to take up a position which would
render it perilous for the French to attempt the siege
either of Hameln or Minden. He had made, however,
but one march from Osnabrück when he received the
news that Broglie had surprised Minden on the day
before, and that the French had thus secured a bridge
over the Weser and free access into Hanover. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>was a most unpleasant surprise for Ferdinand. For a
day he hesitated whether or not to return to Münster,
and then decided to fall back to the Lower Weser, so as
to save his magazine at Nienburg, and, since the French
had set the example of lawlessness at Frankfort, to
occupy the Imperial Free Town of Bremen. On the
14th of July accordingly his headquarters were fixed
at Stolzenau, between Nienburg and Minden on the
Weser, and a detachment was sent to Bremen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 17.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Contades proceeded to reap the fruit of
his very successful movements. Part of his light troops
seized upon Osnabrück, and the rest were sent to levy
contributions in Hanover; M. de Chevreuse was detached
with three thousand men to besiege Lippstadt; d'Armentières
continued to besiege Münster; Broglie's corps
crossed the Weser on the 14th to invest Hameln; and
on the 16th Contades with the main army debouched
into the basin of Minden, and pushed a part of his
army as far to the northward as Petershagen. Ferdinand,
though he could bring but forty-five thousand
men into the field against sixty thousand, advanced southward
next day to offer him battle; but Contades retired
without awaiting his arrival and withdrew to an unassailable
position immediately to south of Minden.
If he could hold Ferdinand inactive while his several
detachments did their work, it was of no profit to him
to hazard a general action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>So far Contades's operations had been masterly.
He had taken Cassel, the capital of Hesse, and had
invested both Lippstadt and Münster; he had further
taken Minden and invested Hameln; and thus he bade
fair to possess himself of the line of the Weser and
to carry the war straight into Hanover. Ferdinand's
position was most critical, and was not rendered
more pleasant to him by a series of uncomplimentary
messages from Frederick the Great. But Contades,
from the moment that he declined battle, seems to have
taken leave, possibly from excessive confidence, of all
energy and ability. His position was, it is true,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
impregnable. His army lay immediately to the south
of Minden, communicating by three bridges with
Broglie's corps on the other side of the Weser. His
right rested on the town and the river, his left on a
mass of wooded hills&mdash;the end of the range that had
separated his army from Ferdinand's&mdash;and the whole of
his front was covered by a wide morass, through which
ran a brook called the Bastau. But though unassailable
from any point, the position had conspicuous defects.
In the first place, it did not leave the army free to move
in all directions; and in the second, it necessitated the
detachment of troops to the south to maintain communication
through Gohfeld and Hervorden with the
French base at Cassel. It was for Ferdinand, by
skilful use of these defects, to entice Contades from
his pinfold to meet him in the open field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 28.<br />July.</div>

<p>Returning to camp at Petershagen after Contades's
withdrawal to Minden, Ferdinand's first step was to
push his picquets forward into a chain of villages that
lay in his front: Todtenhausen on the bank of the
Weser, Fredewald immediately to west of Todtenhausen,
Stemmern and Holthausen somewhat in advance of
Fredewald, and Nord Hemmern, Sud Hemmern, and
Hille still farther to south and west. The occupation of
Hille brought his advanced posts to the western edge
of the morass that covered Contades's front, and to
the head of the one causeway that led across it. On
the 22nd Wangenheim's corps, about ten thousand
strong, was pushed forward to Todtenhausen, where it
remained conspicuous, in advance of the army. In
the midst of these movements came the bad news of the
fall of Münster, which enabled d'Armentières to march
from thence to besiege Lippstadt, and Chevreuse to
return with his detachment to Minden; but this misfortune
only quickened Ferdinand to action. On the
27th the Hereditary Prince marched with six thousand
men south-westward towards Lübbecke, and on the
following day drove from it a body of French irregulars
which was stationed there for the protection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
Contades's left flank. Then turning eastward he
pursued his march against the French communications.
Simultaneously, on the 28th, General Dreve led
the garrison of Bremen against Osnabrück, retook it,
and hastened eastward to join the Hereditary Prince.
The junction effected, the two pressed on towards
Hervorden, and on the 31st established themselves
astride of the road by which all Contades's supplies
must be brought up from the south.</p>

<p>Here, therefore, was a menace in his rear to make
the French General uneasy in his position behind the
morass; and now Ferdinand added a temptation in his
front to induce him the more readily to quit it. On
the 29th the Prince, leaving Wangenheim's corps
isolated about Todtenhausen, led the whole of the rest
of the army a short march to the south-west, and encamped
between Fredewald and Hille. Headquarters
were at Hille, under guard of the Twelfth and
Twentieth Regiments of the British Foot, for the
red-coats held the place of honour on the right of the
line; and picquets were pushed on to Sud Hemmern,
Hartum, and Hahlen, villages on the eastern side of
Hille, by the border of the morass. Finally, from
two to three thousand men were ordered to Lübbecke
to maintain communication with the Hereditary Prince.
Such dispositions might well have appeared hazardous;
but Ferdinand had thought them out in every detail.
Wangenheim's corps, though isolated, was strongly entrenched,
with several guns; while his position covered
the only outlet by which the French could debouch
from behind the marsh. Thereby two important
objects were gained. First, the safe passage of convoys
from the Lower Weser was assured; and secondly, it
was made certain that, before Contades could deploy to
attack Wangenheim in force, Ferdinand with the main
army would have time either to fall upon his flank or
simply to join his own left to Wangenheim's right. To
ensure the swift execution of this latter critical movement,
Ferdinand directed all Generals to acquaint themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
carefully with the ground, and in particular with
the outlets that led from his position to the open plain
before Minden.</p>

<p>Contades meanwhile reasoned, as Ferdinand had
hoped and intended, in a very different fashion. The
Allied army was, to his mind, dispersed in every direction.
Ten thousand men were with the Hereditary Prince
at Gohfeld; at least two thousand more at Lübbecke;
Ferdinand himself, with the greater portion of the army,
seemed so anxious to be within supporting distance of
the Prince that he had left Wangenheim in the air;
while even Wangenheim's corps was not united, but had
detached a few battalions across the river to keep an
eye on Broglie. Still the interruption of his own communications
with Cassel was troublesome; and it would
be well to put an end to that and to all other difficulties
by a decisive blow and a brilliant victory. He therefore
despatched the Duke of Brissac with eight thousand
men to Gohfeld to hold the Hereditary Prince in check,
threw eight bridges over the Bastau for the passage of
his troops across it in as many columns, and ordered
Broglie to be ready to cross the Weser with his corps to
form a ninth column upon his right. The total force
which he could bring into the plain of Minden was
fifty-one thousand men with one hundred and sixty-two
guns. Against it, if all went well, Ferdinand could
oppose forty-one thousand men and one hundred and
seventy guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 1.</div>

<p>A fresh gale was blowing from the south-west
which drowned the stroke of the clocks of Minden, as
midnight closed the last day of July and ushered in the
first of August. Already the French camp was all alert
in the darkness, and the columns were moving off, not
without confusion, to the bridges of the Bastau. An
hour later two white-coated deserters were brought in
by a picquet to the Prince of Anhalt, General Officer
of the day in the Allied army, with the important
intelligence that the whole French army was in motion.
Ferdinand had seen signs of some stir on the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
evening, and had directed that, on the observance of
the slightest movement at the advanced posts, information
should be brought to him at once. Yet two
o'clock came, and three o'clock, before a belated
messenger arrived at headquarters from Anhalt with
the news. Instantly Ferdinand called the whole of his
troops to arms, and ordered them to march to their
appointed positions. His orders had already been
issued, and were clear and precise enough. The
advance was to be in eight columns, and the formation
for battle, as usual, with infantry in the centre and
cavalry on each flank. The first or right-hand column
consisted of twenty-four squadrons of cavalry under
Lord George Sackville, fifteen of them being British
squadrons of the Blues, First and Third Dragoon
Guards, Scots Greys, and Tenth Dragoons. The
second was made up entirely of German artillery; and
the third under Major-General von Spörcke comprised
the Twelfth, Twentieth, Twenty-third, Twenty-fifth,
Thirty-seventh, and Fifty-first regiments of the British
Line. Seven out of the eight columns were formed
and marched off with great promptitude; but in Sackville's
column all was confusion and delay. Some of
the regiments were ready and others were not; and
Sackville himself was not to be found. It was no
good beginning for the British cavalry.</p>

<p>Having given the alarm Ferdinand hastened, with
a single staff-officer accompanying him, to see for himself
how matters stood. It is not difficult to conceive
of his anxiety. Owing to the unpardonable neglect of
Anhalt the French had gained two hours upon him; and
now, when the army had been at last set in motion, the
cavalry of his right wing was not moving with the rest.
There was therefore every likelihood that the village
of Hahlen, on which he had intended to rest his right
flank, might be occupied by the French before Sackville
could be there to prevent them. Instantly galloping
away to Hartum he ordered the picquets stationed
therein to move at once to Hahlen, and then hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
back with all speed to the latter village, only to learn
the bad news that it was already in possession of the
French. Meanwhile not a word had come from
Wangenheim, who, for aught he knew, might be in
serious difficulties. Despatching his solitary aide-de-camp
to Todtenhausen to ascertain how matters were
going on the left, he galloped on alone with his groom
into the plain of Minden. The wind was blowing so
furiously that not a sound even of cannon could be
heard in the direction of the Weser; but before long he
caught sight of the French advancing on Kuttenhausen,
and of a dense cloud of smoke rising before Todtenhausen.
Evidently Wangenheim was hotly engaged.
But meanwhile from windward there came the roar of a
furious cannonade about Hille, where the causeway
issued from the western end of the morass. This could
only be a diversion, for Ferdinand had already sealed
up the outlet of the causeway with five hundred men
and two guns; but to make assurance still surer he now
ordered two more guns and the detachment from
Lübbecke to Hille, and sent information to the
Hereditary Prince of what was passing. Then, galloping
for a moment to the left, Ferdinand satisfied himself
that his columns were advancing, and turned back in
the teeth of the wind to Hahlen. There once again the
stupidity of the Prince of Anhalt had set matters wrong.
He had duly brought up the picquets from Hartum
before Hahlen, as directed, but had halted instead of
clearing the French out of the village, and had thereby
delayed the deployment of the whole of Spörcke's
column. He was bidden to take the village at once,
which he did without difficulty; but having done so
this hopeless officer proceeded to instal himself and his
picquets as if to stay there for ever.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>After the occupation of Hahlen, however, matters
on the right began to adjust themselves. Ferdinand
ordered Captain Foy's battery to the front of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
village to cover the formation of the troops, and was
soon satisfied by the admirable working of these British
guns that all was safe in that quarter. Meanwhile his
aide-de-camp returned from Todtenhausen with intelligence
that Wangenheim was holding his own, though
the enemy had gained ground on his right, where his
flank was uncovered. Probably few commanders have
passed through two worse hours than did Ferdinand at
the opening of the battle of Minden.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him the French had not executed
their own manœuvres without confusion and delay.
It was one defect of Contades's position that he could
not debouch from behind the morass by daylight, since
he would have brought Ferdinand down instantly upon
his flank; and the indiscipline of the French army
among both officers and men was not calculated to
favour orderly movement in the dark. Broglie, a
capable officer, had crossed the river, taken up his
appointed position on the right, and made his dispositions
to fall upon Wangenheim, punctually and in good
order; but he dared not attack until the rest of the
army was formed, so contented himself with a simple
duel of artillery. The rest of the columns shuffled
here and there in helplessness and confusion; and it was
not until Broglie had waited for two full hours that
most of them were at last deployed in some kind of
order. The French line-of-battle was convex in form,
following, as it were, the contour of the walls of Minden,
with the right resting on the Weser and the left on the
morass. Broglie's corps on the right was drawn up in
two lines, the first of infantry, the second of cavalry,
with two powerful batteries in advance. On his left
stood half of the infantry of Contades's army in two
lines, with thirty-four guns before them. Next to these,
in the centre, were fifty-five squadrons of cavalry in two
lines, with a third line of eighteen more in reserve; and
next to this mass of horse stood the left wing, composed
of the rest of the infantry in two lines, with thirty
guns. Thus to all intent the French line-of-battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
consisted of a centre of cavalry with wings of infantry;
but the left wing of infantry was late in arriving at its
position, and its tardiness was not without effect on the
issue of the action.</p>

<p>Observing the excellent practice of Foy's battery
before Hahlen, Ferdinand had already sent Macbean's
British battery to join it and ordered Hase's Hanoverian
brigade of heavy guns to the same position. Then
seeing Spörcke's column of British infantry in the act
of deployment, he sent orders that its advance, when
the time should come, should be made with drums
beating. The order was either misdelivered or misunderstood,
for to his surprise the leading British
brigade shook itself up and began to advance forthwith.
A flight of aides-de-camp galloped off to stop them;
and the line of scarlet halted behind a belt of fir-wood
to await the formation of the rest of the army. In the
first line of Spörcke's division stood, counting from
right to left, the Twelfth, Thirty-seventh, and Twenty-third,
under Brigadier Waldegrave; and in the second,
which extended beyond the first on each flank, the
Twentieth, Fifty-first, and Twenty-fifth, under Brigadier
Kingsley, Hardenberg's Hanoverian battalion, and two
battalions of Hanoverian guards. There then they
stood for a few minutes, while the second line, which
was only partially deployed, hastened to complete the
evolution; when suddenly to the general amazement
the drums again began to roll, and the first line stepped
off once more, advancing rapidly but in perfect order,
straight upon the French horse. The second line,
though its formation was still incomplete, stepped off
likewise in rear of its comrades, deploying as it moved,
and therefore of necessity dropping somewhat in rear.
And so the nine battalions, with the leading brigade
far in advance, swung proudly forward into a cross-fire
of more than sixty cannon, alone and unsupported from
the rest of the line.</p>

<p>No aide-de-camp, gallop though he might, could
stop them now; and their majestic bearing showed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
they would not easily be stopped by an enemy. The
British, being on the right, were the more exposed to
destruction, for the French batteries on their left were
too remote to maintain a really deadly fire; but what
signified a cross-fire and three lines of horse to regiments
that had fought at Dettingen and Fontenoy? For
nearly two hundred yards of the advance the French
guns tore great gaps in their ranks; but they passed
through the tempest of shot unbroken and untamed,
and pressed on with the same majestic steadiness against
the huge motionless bank of the French horse. Then
at last the wall of men and horses started into life, and
eleven squadrons coming forward from the rest bore
straight down upon them. The scarlet battalions stood
firm until the enemy were within ten yards of them;
then pouring in one volley which strewed the ground
with men and horses, they hurled the squadrons back in
confused fragments upon their comrades, and continued
their advance. Ferdinand, perceiving the disorder of
the French, sent an aide-de-camp at full speed to Lord
George Sackville to bring up the British cavalry and
complete the rout. Sackville disputed the meaning of
the order for a time, and then advancing his squadrons
for a short distance, as if to obey it, brought them
once more to a halt. A second messenger came up in
hot haste to ask why the cavalry of the right did not
come on, but Sackville remained stationary, and the
opportunity was lost.</p>

<p>Then shamed and indignant at their defeat the
French horse rallied. Four brigades of infantry and
thirty-two guns came forward from the French left to
enfilade the audacious British foot; and Ferdinand, since
Sackville would not move, advanced Phillips's brigade
of heavy guns in order to parry, if possible, this flanking
attack. Then the second line of the French horse
came thundering down, eager to retrieve their defeat,
upon the nine isolated battalions. For a moment the
lines of scarlet seemed to waver under this triple attack;
but recovering themselves they closed up their ranks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
met the charging squadrons with a storm of musketry
which blasted them off the field. Then turning with
equal fierceness upon the French infantry they beat them
also back with terrible loss. Again an aide-de-camp
flew from Ferdinand's side to Sackville, adjuring him to
bring up the British squadrons only, if no more, to
make good the success; but it was not jealousy of the
foreign squadrons under his command that kept Sackville
back. The messenger delivered his order; but not a
squadron moved. Meanwhile Ferdinand had hurried
forward fresh battalions on his right to save the British
from annihilation; and now the third line of French
horse, the Gendarmerie and the Carbineers, essayed a
third attack upon the nine dauntless battalions and
actually broke through the first line; but was shattered
to pieces by the second and sent the way of its fellows.
A fourth messenger was sent to Sackville, but with no
result. Ferdinand's impatience waxed hot. "When
is that cavalry coming?" he kept exclaiming. "Has
no one seen that cavalry of the right wing?" But no
cavalry came. "Good God! is there no means of
getting that cavalry to advance," he ejaculated in
desperation, and sent a fifth messenger to bring up
Lord Granby with the squadrons of Sackville's second
line only. Granby was about to execute the order,
when Sackville rode up and forbade him; and then, as
if still in doubt as to these repeated orders, Sackville
trotted up to Ferdinand and asked what they might
mean. "My Lord," Ferdinand is said to have
answered, calmly, but with such contempt as may be
imagined, "the opportunity is now passed."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the astonishing attack of the British
infantry had virtually gained the day. Ferdinand's
line had gained time to form and to join with Wangenheim's;
and the guns of the Allies coming up gradually
in increasing force silenced the inferior artillery of
the French. Ferdinand's left wing then took the
offensive, and the German cavalry by a brilliant charge
dispersed the whole of the infantry opposed to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
Between nine and ten o'clock the struggle was practically
over. The French were completely beaten, and retreating
rapidly under the guns of Minden to their pinfold
behind the marsh. Had Sackville's cavalry come forward
when it was bidden, it might have cut the flying French
squadrons to pieces, barred the retreat of most if not all
of the French left wing, and turned the victory into one
of the greatest of all time. As things happened, it fell
to Foy and Macbean of the British Artillery to gather
the laurels of the pursuit. Hard though they had
worked all day, these officers limbered up their guns and
moved with astonishing rapidity along the border of the
marsh, halting from time to time to pound the retreating
masses of the enemy; till at last they unlimbered for
good opposite the bridges of the Bastau and punished
the fugitives so heavily that they would not be rallied
until they had fled far beyond their camp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Hereditary Prince had engaged the
Duke of Brissac at Gohfeld and defeated him, so
that the French communications with Hervorden and
Paderborn were hopelessly severed. The news of this
misfortune seems to have smitten Contades almost
with panic. Had he chosen to fall back by the line of
his advance he could hardly have been stopped by the
inferior force of the Hereditary Prince, and he would
have found supplies and a good position at Hervorden.
But his defeat had crushed all spirit out of him.
Abandoning his communications with Paderborn he
crossed the Weser in the night, broke down the bridge
of Minden, burned his bridges of boats, and retired
through a difficult and distressing country to Cassel,
with an army not only beaten but demoralised.</p>

MINDEN. Aug. 1<sup>st</sup> 1759.<br />
The Action at the moment of the attack of the British Infantry.
</div>
</div>

<p>So ended the battle of Minden, a day at once of
pride and disgrace to the British. The losses of the
Allies amounted to twenty-six hundred killed and
wounded, of which the share of the British amounted to
close on fourteen hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Of the six devoted
regiments who went into action four thousand four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
hundred and thirty-four strong, seventy-eight officers
and twelve hundred and fifty-two men, or about thirty
per cent, were killed or wounded; while the Hanoverian
battalions with them, being on the left or sheltered
flank, lost but twelve per cent. The heaviest sufferers
were the Twelfth, which lost three hundred and two, and
the Twentieth, which lost three hundred and twenty-two
of all ranks; these regiments holding the place of
honour on the right of the first and second lines. The
casualties of the French were acknowledged in the
official lists to amount to seven thousand, though the
letters of Broglie and Contades state the numbers at
from ten to eleven thousand; and the defeated army lost
in addition the greater part of its baggage, seventeen
standards and colours, and forty-three guns. From a
military standpoint the most remarkable feature in the
action was the skill with which Ferdinand contrived to
entice his adversary into the field, reflecting perhaps
even more credit on his judgment of men than on his
knowledge of his profession. Once drawn from behind
the morass into the plain, Contades made singularly
feeble and meaningless dispositions: and the formation
of his line with cavalry in the centre and infantry on
the flanks was, in the circumstances, simply grotesque.
He seems indeed to have had no very clear idea as to
what he really meant to do. If he had designed to
overwhelm Wangenheim's isolated corps&mdash;and no doubt
he had some vague notion of the kind&mdash;the obvious
course was to launch Broglie straight at him independently,
and himself to protect Broglie's flank with the
main army. What he actually did was to turn Broglie's
corps into the right wing of an united army, and so
practically to fetter it for all decisive action. On the
other hand, all preconcerted arrangements on both sides
were upset by the extraordinary attack of the British
infantry, a feat of gallantry and endurance that stands,
so far as I know, absolutely without a parallel. "I
never thought," said Contades bitterly, "to see a single
line of infantry break through three lines of cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
ranked in order of battle, and tumble them to ruin."
"Never," grimly wrote Westphalen, the chief of
Ferdinand's staff, "were so many boots and saddles seen
on a battlefield as opposite to the English and the
Hanoverian Guards." Next to this attack the feature
that seems to have attracted most attention among both
contemporary and modern critics, was the remarkable
efficiency of the British artillery. The handling of the
artillery generally at Minden, which was entrusted to
the Count of Lippe-Bückeburg, was very greatly
admired: but Westphalen, who passed lightly over the
deeds of the infantry, went out of his way to write that,
though every battery had done well, the English batteries
had done wonders. And indeed some British guns which
were attached to Wangenheim's corps on the left earned
not less praise than those of Foy and Macbean on the
right. The palm of the cavalry fell to the Germans, and
in particular to a few squadrons of Prussian dragoons
lent by Frederick the Great, which earned it brilliantly.
It would have fallen to the British but for Sackville.</p>

<p>The part played by this deplorable man did not end
with the battle. Ferdinand in general orders made
scathing allusion to his conduct without mentioning his
name; and Sackville was presently superseded and sent
home. There he was tried by court-martial and pronounced
unfit to serve the King in any military capacity
whatever&mdash;a hard sentence but probably no more than
just. Sackville was admitted to be an extremely able
man; and as he had passed through Fontenoy and been
wounded in that action, it is not easy to call him a
coward. But the courage of some men is not the same
on every day; and the evidence produced at the court-martial
shows, I think, too plainly that on the day of
Minden Sackville's courage failed him.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The King
published the sentence of his dismissal from the Army
in a special order, with very severe but not undeserved
comment; and Lord George Sackville henceforth disappears
from British battlefields. But we shall meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
with him again as a Minister of War, and the meeting
will not be a pleasant one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 2.<br />Aug. 5.<br />Aug. 18.<br />Aug. 24.<br />Aug. 25.<br />Sept. 19.</div>

<p>On the day following the battle the Hereditary
Prince crossed the Weser in pursuit of the French, and
overtaking their rear-guard at Einbeck captured many
prisoners and much spoil, but failed to arrest the retreat
of the main body. Contades, therefore, succeeded in
bringing his troops back to Cassel, half starved, worn
out by hard marching, and utterly demoralised by
indiscipline and pillage. D'Armentières, on hearing of
his chief's defeat, raised the siege of Lippstadt and
marched eastward to meet him. Ferdinand meanwhile,
having received the surrender of Minden, advanced by
Bielefeld and Paderborn south-eastward upon Corbach,
so as to turn Contades's left flank. On the 18th Contades,
seeing his communications endangered, evacuated
Cassel and retired by forced marches to Marburg, where
he took up a strong position. Cassel capitulated to the
Allies on the following day; and Ferdinand, while still
pursuing his march southward, detached seven thousand
men to recapture Münster. Marshal d'Estrées then
arrived to supersede Contades; but little came of this
change of command. Renewed menace from the westward
upon the French communications forced him to withdraw
from the line of the Ohm and Lahn, and to fall
back to Giessen. Ferdinand at once laid siege to Marburg,
which fell within a week, and finally on the 19th
of September he encamped at Kroffdorf, a little to north-west
of Giessen, over against the French camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nov. 21.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the siege of Münster had gone ill for the
Allies, and had been turned into a blockade. Ferdinand,
after sending additional troops thither, found himself
too weak to attempt further operations until the fall of
the town; and during this interval Broglie, who had been
appointed to the supreme command, had received a
reinforcement of ten thousand Würtembergers. Thus
strengthened he tried incessantly with a detached corps
of twenty thousand men to interrupt Ferdinand's communications
with Cassel, but in vain; and finally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Hereditary Prince attacked this corps at Fulda, defeated
it signally, and then turning upon Broglie's right flank
forced him to retire to Friedberg. Ferdinand then
blockaded Giessen; but at this point further operations
were stayed. Ever since his disastrous defeat by the
Russians at Kunersdorf in August, Frederick the Great
had pressed Ferdinand for reinforcements; and the
detachment of twelve thousand troops to the King not
only rendered the Prince powerless for further aggression,
but obliged him also to raise the blockade of
Giessen. In January 1760 both armies retired into
winter-quarters. The French occupied much the same
ground as at the beginning of the campaign; and the
Allies likewise were distributed into two divisions, the
army of Westphalia extending from Münster through
Paderborn to the Weser, the army of Hesse from Marburg
eastward to the Werra. Thus ended the campaign
of 1759, leaving both parties in occupation of the same
territory as at its beginning; but it had branded the
French with the discredit of a great defeat, and had
heightened in the Allies their contempt for their enemy
and their confidence in their chief.</p>

    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1759.</div>

<p class="noindent">Never in the whole course of her history had come to
England such a year of triumph as 1759. Opening with
the capture of Goree in January, its later months had
brought one unbroken tale of success, of Madras saved
and Masulipatam taken in India, of Quebec captured
in Canada, of Minden won in Germany, of one
French fleet worsted by Boscawen off the Portuguese
coast, of another defeated by Hawke in the romantic
action of Quiberon Bay. Such was the story with
which King George the Second met his Parliament for
the last time in his life; and Pitt did not fail to turn it
to good account. A monument was voted to Wolfe in
Westminster Abbey; thanks were given to Hawke,
Saunders and Holmes of the Navy, and to Monckton,
Murray and Townsend of the Army; and the military
estimates were passed with little difficulty. It was
ordered that Ferdinand's army should be augmented
from Great Britain, Brunswick, and Hesse alike. The
full number of national troops voted for the British
Establishment exceeded one hundred thousand men;
the embodied militia augmented this total by twenty
thousand, and the German troops in the pay of England
by fifty-five thousand more; while another twelve
thousand men at home and abroad, which were borne on
the Irish Establishment, raised it to close on one hundred
and ninety thousand men. Before the campaign of 1760
was opened, the infantry of the British Line had increased
to ninety-six regiments; England contributing one new
corps, Wales one, Scotland five, and Ireland four, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
which were disbanded at the close of the war.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> To
these there were added later in the year six new
regiments of Light Dragoons. The first was formed in
August under Colonel John Burgoyne, which took rank
as the Sixteenth Dragoons, and is now known to us as the
Sixteenth Lancers; the second, created in October by
Lord Aberdour, soon perished and left no mark behind
it; and the third was raised under rather remarkable
conditions by Colonel John Hale in November. Colonel
Hale, originally of the Blues and later of the Forty-third
Foot, was the officer who brought back the
despatches reporting the victory of Quebec. Finding
on his arrival in England in October that there was still
some alarm of a French invasion, he volunteered to form a
regiment of the footmen and chairmen of London and
to lead them against the best household troops of France;
an offer which so delighted Pitt that he reported it to
the House of Commons. Finally, he engaged himself to
raise a strong regiment of light dragoons without levy-money
for men or horses, promising that any men or
horses objected to on review by the inspecting officer
should be replaced without expense to the country, and
that the whole corps should be completed within two
months. The offer was accepted, and the regiment was
raised at the sole expense of the officers within the
space, as it is said, of seventeen days. The number was
not inappropriate; for though first known, during the
few years while Aberdour's lasted, as the Eighteenth,
this regiment, still conspicuous by the white facings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
the badge of skull and crossbones which Hale selected
for it, remains with us as the Seventeenth Lancers.
The three remaining corps, which raised the number of
regiments of dragoons to twenty-one, were too short-lived
to merit more than mere mention.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1760.<br />Feb.</div>

<p>The menace of French invasion was rather ludicrously
realised in February by a descent of the French
privateer, Thurot, with five ships upon Carrickfergus.
Landing about a thousand troops, he received the
surrender of the town after a skirmish with the garrison,
plundered it, contrary to the terms of the capitulation,
and re-embarked. His squadron, however, was almost
immediately caught by three British men-of-war, when
after a short action Thurot was killed and every one of
his ships captured. This tragic termination to Thurot's
escapade relieved the general tension, and restored the
country's confidence.</p>

<p>So foolish a raid was not likely to produce any
change in Pitt's preparations for the reinforcement of
Ferdinand, who needed to be specially strengthened
after the disasters that had befallen King Frederick at
Kunersdorf and at Maxen. In January it was decided
to send three more regiments of British cavalry to
Germany; and a few weeks later the number was
increased to five. In May a further reinforcement of
six battalions and two regiments of Highlanders was
promised, and in June two additional regiments of
cavalry; making up a total of close on ten thousand
men.<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The troops were shipped to the Weser instead
of, as heretofore, to Emden, and seem to have been
despatched with commendable promptitude; for the
six regiments of foot, though only warned for service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>on the 1st of May, were actually reviewed by Ferdinand
in his camp at Fritzlar on the 17th of June, and
were declared by him to be in a most satisfactory
condition.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">May.<br />June 20.<br />June 22.<br />June 24.<br />July.</div>

<p>The campaign of 1759 having been prolonged so
far into the winter, Ferdinand gave his army rest until
late in May. At length on the 20th he called the
infantry of the army of Hesse from its cantonments,
and posted the main body under his own command at
Fritzlar, with one corps advanced to Hersfeld on the
Fulda to protect his left, and a second under General
Imhoff at Kirchhain, on the Ohm. It was his intention
that, in case of the enemy's advance, Imhoff should call
in the detachment from Hersfeld to Homberg, a little
to the south of Kirchhain on a bend of the Ohm,
where there was a position, before long to be better
known to us, in which he could bar the way to a far
superior force. Simultaneously the army of Westphalia
moved to its line of the previous year, from Coesfeld
eastward to Hamm. In these positions the Allies
remained for nearly a month before the French made
the least sign of movement; when at last the army
of the Lower Rhine under the Count of St. Germain
assembled at Düsseldorf, and crossing the Rhine advanced
to Dortmund. From this centre it was open to St.
Germain to advance either northward against Münster
or eastward against Lippstadt; but it was tolerably
evident that his real design was to join the army of the
Main, and to operate against the right flank of the
Allied army of Hesse. At about the same time Broglie
concentrated the army of the Main a little to the east
of Giessen, and began his advance northward. The
Hereditary Prince at once fell back from Hersfeld with
his detachment towards the Ohm, while Ferdinand
moved southward as far as Ziegenhain to join Imhoff,
with every intention of making Broglie fight him before
he advanced another mile. To his infinite disgust,
however, he learned that Imhoff had abandoned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
position entrusted to him, and had ordered the whole
of the advanced corps back to Kirchhain. Thus the
most effective barrier in Hesse was opened to the
French; Ferdinand perforce halted; and Broglie
pushed on without delay to Homberg, whence turning
eastward he encamped in the face of Ferdinand's
army at Neustadt. In this situation both armies remained
for a whole fortnight inactive, though not two
hours' march apart, neither daring to attack the other,
and each waiting for the other to make the next movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 8.<br />July 10.</div>

<p>Broglie brought the deadlock to an end. Sending
orders to St. Germain to march from Dortmund on the
4th of July, and to meet him at Corbach, he marched
on the night of the 7th north-westward upon Frankenberg.
Ferdinand on learning of his movements next
day marched also northward with all speed, pushing
forward a strong advanced corps under the Hereditary
Prince by way of Sachsenhausen upon Corbach, to bar
the outlet of the defile through which Broglie's army
must pass into the plain, and so to hinder his junction
with St. Germain. The French, however, had gained too
long a start. St. Germain, though he distressed his troops
terribly by the speed of his march, succeeded in passing
through the defile from the north; and Broglie, hastening
up from the south, found his troops forming in order
of battle just as the Hereditary Prince debouched into
the plain from Sachsenhausen. As not more than ten
thousand of the French were yet deployed, the Prince
attacked; but was soon driven back by superior numbers
as the rest of the French came up, and finally retired
with the loss of five hundred men and fifteen guns, seven
of which last were British. It fell to the British infantry
with the Prince, the Fifth, Twenty-fourth, Fiftieth, and
Fifty-first regiments, to cover the retreat; but so hard
were they pressed that the Prince only extricated them
by putting himself at the head of two squadrons of the
First and Third Dragoon Guards, and leading them to a
desperate charge. Fortunately the squadrons responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
superbly,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and so the rear-guard was saved; but the
Prince had received an unpleasant reverse, and the
French had secured their first object with signal success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 12.</div>

<p>The Allied army of Westphalia, under General von
Spörcke, arrived on the scene in obedience to orders
two days after the action, and was posted at Volksmarsen
on the Diemel to protect Ferdinand's right; and then
once more the two hosts remained motionless and face
to face, the French at Corbach, the Allies at Sachsenhausen.
Ferdinand's total force was sixty-six thousand
men only, while that of the French numbered one
hundred and thirty thousand;<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> yet such was the
difference in the quality of the two armies that Broglie
dared not act except with extreme caution. His principal
object was to envelope Ferdinand's right and cut him
off from Westphalia at the line of the Diemel; and
Ferdinand accordingly resolved to distract Broglie's
attention to the opposite flank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 15.<br />July 16.</div>

<p>Having intelligence that a party of the enemy
under General Glaubitz, consisting of six battalions, a
regiment of Hussars, and a number of light troops, was
on its way to Ziegenhain from Marburg, evidently with
the object of disturbing his communications, Ferdinand,
on the night of the 14th, detached the Hereditary
Prince to take command of six battalions which were
lying at Fritzlar, and to attack it. Accordingly
on the following morning the Prince marched rapidly
southward, being joined on the way by a regiment of
German hussars, and by the Fifteenth Light Dragoons,
which had just arrived from England. On reaching
the vicinity of Ziegenhain, he found that Glaubitz
was encamped farther to the west, near the village of
Emsdorff. His troops being exhausted by a long
march, the Prince halted for the night at Treysa, and
continuing his advance early on the morrow, picked up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>two more bodies of irregulars, horse and foot, which
were on their way to him, and pushed on with his
mounted troops only, to reconnoitre the enemy's
position. He found the French posted at the mouth of
a gorge in the mountains, fronting to north-east, astride
of the two roads that lead from Kirchhain to Fritzlar
and to Ziegenhain. Their right lay in rear of the village
of Erxdorff, and their left in front of the village of
Emsdorff, resting on a forest some three miles long.
The Prince and General Lückner, who was with him,
entered the forest, but found neither picquets nor
sentries; they pushed forward through the corn-fields
to within half a mile of the camp, but saw neither
vedettes, nor patrols, nor so much as a main-guard;
nay, Erxdorff itself, though within less than a mile of
the camp, was not occupied. They stole back well
content with what they had seen.</p>

<p>Waiting till eleven o'clock for his infantry to join
him, the Prince posted one battalion, Lückner's regiment
of hussars and the Fifteenth Light Dragoons, in a
hollow a mile before Erxdorff; then taking the five
remaining battalions, together with the irregular troops
and four guns, he fetched a compass through the forest
and came in full upon the enemy's left flank. The
French were completely surprised. Two battalions had
barely time to form towards the forest before the
Prince's infantry came upon them, poured in a volley
which laid three hundred men low, and drove back the
rest upon Glaubitz's remaining infantry, which was
falling in hurriedly in rear of the camp. Simultaneously
Lückner, at the sound of the firing, came galloping up on
the French right with his cavalry; whereupon the entire
French force abandoned its camp and retired through
the woods in their rear towards Langenstein. Here
they rallied; but Lückner's single battalion hurried on
beyond them to bar their way over the Ohm to westward,
while the Fifteenth, pressing on along their flank,
stationed itself across the road to Amöneberg, and
charging full upon them headed them back from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
side. With some difficulty the French repelled the
attack, and turning about to south-eastward made for a
wood not far away, hoping to pass through it and so to
escape to the south. But on arriving at the southern
edge of the wood they found every outlet blocked by
the Prince's mounted irregulars. Perforce they turned
back through the wood again and emerged on to the
open ground on its western side, trusting that some
marshy ground, which lay in the way of the Prince's
cavalry, would secure them from further pursuit. But
they had not marched over the plain for more than a
mile before the hussars and light dragoons were upon
them again, and the Fifteenth for the second time
crashed single-handed into the midst of them, cutting
them down by scores and capturing one battalion
complete. With great difficulty the remnant of the
French beat back their pursuers and continued the
retreat: half of them had been killed or captured, or
had dropped down unable to march farther, but the
rest struggled gallantly on. Reaching an open wood
they again halted and formed for action. The Prince,
still close at their heels with his cavalry, thereupon
surrounded them and summoned them to surrender;
and the French commander, despairing of further
resistance in the exhausted state of his troops, was
obliged to yield.</p>

<p>So ended the action which is still commemorated on
the appointments of the Fifteenth Hussars by the name
of Emsdorff. The French camp had been surprised at
noon; and the last fragment of their force capitulated
at six o'clock in the evening, having striven manfully
but in vain to shake off the implacable enemy that had
hunted them for nearly twenty miles. The loss of the
French in killed and wounded is unknown, though it
must have been considerable, but the prisoners taken
numbered twenty-six hundred, while nine colours and
five guns were also captured. The total loss of the
Prince's troops did not exceed one hundred and eighty-six
men and one hundred and eighty-one horses, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
which one hundred and twenty-five men and one
hundred and sixty-eight horses belonged to the Fifteenth.
It was the Fifteenth, in fact, that did all the fighting.
The other regiments engaged did not lose twenty men
apiece. The infantry could not keep pace with the
pursuit after they reached Langenstein, and the two
other corps of cavalry, though they did excellent work
in heading back the enemy, never came to close quarters.
Lückner's hussars did not lose a man nor a horse, and
of the mounted irregulars but twenty-three men and
horses were killed or wounded. It was the Fifteenth
alone, a young regiment that had never been under
fire, which thrice charged five times its numbers of
French infantry and rode through them; and the success
of the action was ascribed to them and to them only.
Their gallantry indeed was the amazement of the whole
army.<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The tradition of charging home, as shall be
seen in due time both in Flanders and in Spain, remained
with the regiment, and doubtless remains with it to
this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 23.<br />July 25-27.<br />July 29.<br />July 30.</div>

<p>This brilliant exploit was some compensation to
the Allies for past mishaps; but a week later Broglie
sought to turn the scale by more serious operations.
On the 23rd he divided his army into three corps, of
which he sent one round Ferdinand's left flank under
Prince Xavier of Saxony to threaten Cassel, and a second
to force back Spörcke on his right from Volksmarsen,
while the main body under his own command advanced
to Sachsenhausen. Perforce Ferdinand retreated north-westward
to Kalle, his rear-guard being incessantly and
severely engaged throughout the movement; whereupon
Broglie, seeing the way to be clear, detached a corps
under the Chevalier de Muy, who had recently arrived
to relieve the Count of St. Germain, across the Diemel
to Warburg, in order to cut off the Allies from Westphalia.
The Marshal himself meanwhile moved up
parallel to Ferdinand on the eastern side towards Kalle,
and Prince Xavier pressed still closer upon Cassel. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
being evident to Ferdinand that either Cassel or Westphalia
must be abandoned, he detached a force under
General Kielmansegge to strengthen the garrison of
Cassel and resolved to attack de Muy. Accordingly,
on the afternoon of the 29th Spörcke's corps crossed
the Diemel to Liebenau, followed on the same evening
by that of the Hereditary Prince; and on the 30th
their combined force, not exceeding in all fourteen
thousand men, encamped between Liebenau and
Corbeke with its left on the Diemel, facing west. At
dawn of the same morning Broglie's army debouched
from several quarters simultaneously against the Allied
camp at Kalle, but drew off after some hours of
cannonade; and Ferdinand, satisfied through other signs
that this demonstration was intended only to cover the
movement of the French towards Cassel, resolved to
pass the Diemel without delay and to deliver his stroke
against de Muy.</p>

<p>Spörcke and the Hereditary Prince had meanwhile
reconnoitred de Muy's position and had recommended
that their own corps should turn its left flank, while
Ferdinand with the main army advanced against its
front. De Muy, with about twenty thousand men,
occupied a high ridge across a bend of the Diemel,
facing north-east, with his right resting on Warburg
and his left near the village of Ochsendorf. To his left
rear rose a circular hill crowned by a tower, and on his
left front lay a village named Poppenheim. It was
arranged that the corps of Spörcke and the Hereditary
Prince should advance westward in two columns from
Corbeke and form up in three lines between the tower
and Poppenheim, so as to fall on de Muy's left flank
and rear, while Ferdinand crossing the Diemel at
Liebenau should attack his centre and right. As the
camp between Liebenau and Corbeke lay about ten miles
from de Muy's, and as Ferdinand's camp lay some
fifteen miles to the south of the Diemel from Liebenau,
the operation called for extreme nicety in the execution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 31.</div>

<p>At nine o'clock on the evening of the 30th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
Ferdinand's army marched from Kalle, and at six
o'clock on the following morning the heads of his
columns passed the Diemel and debouched on the
heights of Corbeke. They arrived, however, at later
than the appointed hour. The passage of the Diemel
had caused much delay; and not all the haste of officers
nor the eagerness of men could bring the army forward
the quicker. At seven o'clock Spörcke and the
Hereditary Prince, after much anxious waiting, decided
to march from Corbeke before more time should be
lost. The northern column, which included the right
wing of all three arms, moved by Gross Eider and
Ochsendorf upon the tower; the southern, composed of
the left wing, by Klein Eider and Poppenheim. Both
columns were led by British troops&mdash;the northern by the
Royal Dragoons, whose place was on the extreme right
of the first line, while the British grenadiers, massed in
two battalions under Colonels Maxwell and Daulhatt,<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
marched at the head of the infantry. The southern
was headed by the Seventh Dragoons, with Keith's and
Campbell's Highlanders<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> following them to cover the
grenadiers in second line.</p>

<p>At half-past one the Hereditary Prince, having
posted his artillery on the outskirts <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of Ochsendorf of'">of Ochsendorf and</ins>
Poppenheim, opened fire as the signal for attack; and
at the same time the British grenadiers began to file
through Ochsendorf. Certain French battalions, which
de Muy had thrown back <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en potence</i> to protect his left
flank, thereupon retired without firing, until it was perceived
that the Allies were making for the steep hill in
rear of the French position. Then one battalion of
Regiment Bourbonnois deliberately faced about and
marched off to occupy the hill. To permit such a
thing would have been to derange the whole of the
plans of the Allies, so it was necessary to prevent it at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>any cost. Colonel Beckwith with ten grenadiers ran
forward, keeping out of sight of the French, to reach
the hill before them; the Prince himself with thirty
more hurried after him; and with this handful of men,
all panting and breathless, they crowned the crest of the
height. Bourbonnois arriving on the scene a little later
found itself greeted by a sharp fire, and, being unable
to see the numbers opposed to it, halted for ten minutes
to allow its second battalion to come up. The delay
gave time for Daulhatt's entire battalion of grenadiers
to join Beckwith's little party; and then the two
battalions of Bourbonnois attacked in earnest, and the
combat between French and British, at odds of two
against one, became most fierce and stubborn. The
disparity of numbers however, was too great; and
Daulhatt's men after a gallant struggle were beginning
to give way, when Maxwell's battalion came up in the
nick of time to support them. This reinforcement
redressed the balance of the fight; Daulhatt's men
speedily rallied, and the contest for the hill was renewed.
The French, however, prepared to send fresh
battalions in support of Bourbonnois, and the situation
of the British became critical; for a battery of artillery,
which was on its way to the hill to support them, got
into difficulties in a defile near Ochsendorf and blocked
the advance of the rest of the northern column.
Fortunately it was extricated, though none too soon,
and being brought up to the hill was speedily in action;
while the head of the southern column likewise coming
up took the French reinforcements in flank and drove
them back in disorder. The Royals and Seventh
Dragoons were then let loose upon the broken French
battalions, completing their discomfiture and taking
many prisoners.</p>

<p>So far the turning movement had succeeded; but its
success was not yet assured, for only a portion of the
southern column was yet formed for action, and the
troops on the field were becoming exhausted. De Muy
might yet have hoped to turn the scale in his left, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
his attention was suddenly called to the advance of
troops upon his front. After desperate but fruitless
efforts it had been found that the infantry of Ferdinand's
army could not hope to arrive in time to take part in
the action. The British battalions, urged by General
Waldegrave, struggled manfully to get forward, but the
day was hot, and the ground was difficult and in many
places marshy: the men would not fall out, but they
dropped down insensible from fatigue in spite of themselves.
Ferdinand therefore ordered Lord Granby, who
had succeeded to Sackville, to advance with the twenty-two
squadrons of British cavalry and the British artillery
alone. Away therefore they started at the trot, the
guns accompanying them at a speed which amazed all
beholders.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Two hours of trotting brought them at
last within sight of the enemy; and Granby at once
turned them upon the cavalry of de Muy's right wing.
The pace was checked for a brief moment as the
squadrons formed in two lines for the attack. In the
first line from right to left were the First, Third, and
Second Dragoon Guards, in one brigade, the Blues,
Seventh, and Sixth Dragoon Guards in another; in the
second line were the Greys, Tenth, Sixth, and Eleventh
Dragoons. Then the advance was resumed, Granby
riding at the head of the Blues, his own regiment, and
well in front of all. His hat flew from his head,
revealing a bald head which shone conspicuous in the
sun, as the trot grew into gallop and the lines came
thundering on. The French squadrons wavered for a
moment, and then, with the exception of three only,
turned and fled without awaiting the shock. The
scarlet ranks promptly wheeled round upon the flank
and rear of the French infantry; whereupon the three
French squadrons that had stood firm plunged gallantly
down on the flank of the King's Dragoon Guards, and
overthrew them. But the Blues quickly came up to
liberate their comrades; and the devoted little band of
Frenchmen was cut to pieces. The French infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
finding itself now attacked on both flanks, broke and
fled; and the whole of de Muy's men, horse and foot,
rushed down to the Diemel, and, without even looking
for the bridges, threw down their arms and splashed
frantically through the fords. A party of French
irregulars in Warburg tried likewise to escape, but was
caught by the cavalry and well-nigh annihilated. Finally,
the British batteries came down to the river at a gallop,
unlimbered on the bank, and played on the fugitives so
destructively as wholly to prevent them from reforming.
Granby presently crossed the river in pursuit with ten
squadrons; and the fragments of de Muy's corps retired
in disorder to Volksmarsen. Thus brilliantly ended the
action of Warburg.</p>

<p>The loss of the French was set down at from six to
eight thousand men, killed, wounded, and taken, while
twelve guns remained as trophies in the hands of the
victors. The Allies lost just over twelve hundred men,
of whom no less than two hundred and forty belonged
to Maxwell's grenadiers; Daulhatt's battalion also suffering
very severely. The losses of the cavalry were
trifling. Altogether the action was a brilliant little
affair, well designed and, despite the tardiness of Ferdinand's
arrival, well executed. For the British it redeemed
the character of the cavalry which had been
so shamefully sacrificed by Sackville at Minden; since
it was evidently the recollection of that disgrace which
spurred Granby on to so rapid an advance and so headlong
an attack. For Ferdinand the victory effectually
opened the way into Westphalia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 10.</div>

<p>Meanwhile it had been found impossible to defend
Cassel against Broglie's overwhelming numbers; and the
town was accordingly abandoned. It was no fault of
Ferdinand's that Hesse was thus laid at the mercy of
the French; indeed, with an army weaker in numbers
by one-half than his enemy's, he had done well to save
Westphalia. He now took up a position along the
Diemel from Trendelburg to Stadtbergen, so as to seal
up every passage over the river, while Broglie posted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
main army over against him on the opposite bank. The
Marshal's superiority in numbers, however, enabled him,
while holding the Allies in check with the bulk of his
army, to detach independent corps for minor operations,
though he took even such enterprises in hand with
redoubled caution after the lessons of Emsdorff and
Warburg. His first essay was the reduction of Ziegenhain,
which surrendered after a siege of ten days; and
concurrently he moved a corps under Prince Xavier
eastward against Münden, which occupied Göttingen
and pushed detachments forward as far north as Nordheim
and Einbeck. This latter movement carried the
war unpleasantly far into Hanoverian territory; but
Ferdinand none the less remained immovable on the
Diemel. Broglie thereupon broke up his camp on that
river and shifted his position eastward to Immenhausen,
to support the operations of Prince Xavier. This placed
Ferdinand in an awkward dilemma. He had sent a
few troops to Beverungen on the Weser to check
Xavier's advanced parties; but this detachment, though
it had done its work well, was not strong enough to
make head against an invasion in real force. Moreover
Einbeck was disagreeably near to the border of his
brother's dominions of Brunswick, which he would fain
have saved from invasion if he could. Yet he could not
move to the east bank of the Weser without uncovering
Lippstadt, the one fortress which enabled him to
prevent the perfect concert of the French armies of the
Rhine and Main. In fact the situation was one of
extreme trial and embarrassment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept.</div>

<p>Ferdinand, whose light troops and irregulars were
never idle while they could make mischief, first tried the
effect of a raid with a flying column upon Broglie's communications
with Frankfort; but this enterprise, though
it alarmed the French and somewhat threw back their
preparations, only partially achieved its object. On the
other hand, it was always open to Ferdinand to stay
where he was till want of forage should compel Broglie
to retire; but this, though an infallible method, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
slow, and would mean that the country would be converted
into a desert, through which it would be impossible
to follow the French during their retreat. He therefore
resolved to make a diversion by carrying the war suddenly
to the Rhine. Broglie, in his anxiety to invade
Hanover and Brunswick, had denuded Wesel of the
greater part of its garrison. If Ferdinand could snatch
Wesel, the base of the Army of the Rhine, from him,
the diversion would be a telling stroke indeed.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 23.<br />Oct. 1-2.<br />October.</div>

<p>All through the first days of September Ferdinand's
preparations for this undertaking went steadily and
silently forward; and on the 22nd a powerful train of
siege-artillery, under the Count of Lippe-Bückeburg,
marched away for Wesel, followed three days later
by the Hereditary Prince with about ten thousand
Hanoverians and Hessians. The Count was to conduct
the siege and the Prince to cover it. Broglie, on
learning of their departure, at once detached a strong
corps under the Marquis of Castries to follow them; to
which Ferdinand retorted by sending to the Prince one
Hanoverian and ten British battalions, together with a
Hessian regiment and three British regiments of cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
Meanwhile the Prince's advanced parties had crossed the
Rhine below Wesel on the 29th of September, and had
surprised two or three small garrisons. The commandant
of Wesel thereupon broke down the bridge which
connected it with the western bank of the Rhine; and
none too soon, for on the 30th the Prince came up and
invested the fortress. The siege, however, progressed
but slowly owing to rain and stormy weather; and
meanwhile Castries was advancing by forced marches,
despite the dreadful state of the roads, along a route full
fifty miles south of the Prince's, to the Rhine. On the
12th of October he crossed the river at Cologne and
pushed on without delay to Rheinberg, where he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>joined by reinforcements from Brabant. Considering
the unspeakable difficulties of foul weather and almost
impassable roads, this march of Castries stands out as a
very fine feat of resolution and endurance.</p>

<p>The advance of French troops from the side of
Brabant was a complication which neither Ferdinand
nor the Hereditary Prince had foreseen. In fact it
almost deprived the advance to Wesel of the character
of a diversion. Castries had in Rheinberg thirty
battalions and thirty-eight squadrons besides irregular
troops, and was expecting further reinforcements;
whereas the Prince, weakened by the absence of men in
the trenches before Wesel, could muster but twenty-one
battalions and twenty-two squadrons to meet him. It
was open to the Prince either to fight against superior
numbers or to retreat; and he elected to fight. Castries
had taken up a position behind the Eugenian Canal,
facing north-west, with his right resting on Rheinberg,
and with the abbey of Kloster Kampen, on the northern
side of the canal, before his left front. Immediately
before his left, but on his own side of the canal, stood
the village of Kampenbröck, consisting of several
scattered houses with gardens, ditches, and hedges. In
front and to the left, or western, side of Kampenbröck
was a morass covered by a straggling wood of sparse and
stunted trees, through which were cut paths to a bridge
that connected the village with the abbey on the other
side of the canal. Across this bridge lay the Prince's
only way to penetrate into the French camp; and
Castries had been careful to guard the passage by
posting no less than two thousand irregular troops in
and about the abbey. The only possible chance for the
Prince lay in an attack by surprise.</p>

<p>Waiting until the 15th to collect his troops, the
Prince marched from before Wesel in dead silence at
one hour before midnight. The force was disposed in
five divisions. The Fifteenth Light Dragoons, Royal
and Inniskilling Dragoons, and Prussian hussars formed
the advanced guard; then came the support, of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
battalions of Highlanders and as many of British
grenadiers; then the main body of the Twentieth and
Twenty-fifth British Foot, with eight Hanoverian
battalions, all under command of General Waldegrave;
then the reserve, of the Eleventh, Twenty-third, Thirty-third
and Fifty-first British Foot, with three German
battalions, under General Howard; then a rear-guard of
the Tenth British Dragoons and ten German squadrons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oct. 16.</div>

<p>At three o'clock on the morning of the 16th the
advanced parties of the Allies come upon the outposts
of the French irregulars, a mile and a half beyond
Kloster Kampen. Despite the strict orders of the
Prince one or two shots were fired, but fortunately
without alarming the enemy; and the Allies pursued
their march unmolested to the bridge, thus cutting off
the irregulars in the abbey from the French main body.
These isolated troops were then attacked and utterly
dispersed; and while the musketry was still crackling
loud round the abbey's walls the Prince stealing silently
on with the British grenadiers penetrated into the wood
and into the village of Kampenbröck, so quietly and
yet so swiftly that he was in possession before the enemy
were aware of his presence. The French in camp had,
however, been alarmed by the firing, and some of the
principal officers had turned the men out and gone
forward to the wood to reconnoitre. One of these, the
Chevalier d'Assas, on his way to visit the picquets of
his regiment, suddenly found himself among the British
grenadiers, but distinguishing no one but the Prince in
the darkness advanced towards him with the words,
"Sir, you are my prisoner." "On the contrary,"
answered the Prince, "you are mine, for these are my
grenadiers"; and as he spoke the men closed round
d'Assas with bayonets fixed. "Auvergne, Auvergne,
the enemy is on us,"<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> shouted d'Assas to his regiment
without a moment's hesitation at the top of his voice;
and before the words were out of his mouth a dozen
bayonets pierced through his body and laid him dead on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
the ground. None the less the devotion of the gallant
man sufficed to save the French army. Regiment
Auvergne came down at once to d'Assas' call; Castries
hastily brought down two more battalions to support
it; and three more battalions arrived directly after to
protect their flank. The supports of the Allies came
up in their turn; and the fight swayed furiously backward
and forward until daylight, when the French
brought up additional battalions from their right. The
reserves of the Allies were promptly and frequently
summoned, but through some mistake were not to be
found. Still the little force of British and Hanoverians
fought desperately on, until the Prince himself fell
wounded from his horse; and then, their ammunition
being exhausted, they yielded to superior numbers in
front and flank and suddenly gave way. The French
broke their ranks with loud cries of exultation for the
pursuit, when the Fifteenth Light Dragoons swooped
down upon them, charging home as their custom is,
broke up two battalions completely, and drove the rest
flying back in confusion upon their comrades. The
French cavalry now came forward in overwhelming
numbers and handled the British squadrons very
roughly; but the charge of the Fifteenth had given
the infantry time to rally, and to make their retreat in
good order. The reserve appeared at Kloster Kampen
in time to cover the retiring troops, and by noon the
fight of Kloster Kampen was over.</p>

<p>The loss of the Allies amounted to nearly twelve
hundred killed and wounded and sixteen hundred
prisoners, in addition to which one gun and one British
colour were captured. That of the French was as
heavy and heavier, amounting to twenty-seven hundred
killed and wounded and three hundred prisoners. The
struggle was unusually stubborn and murderous, and
the fire of the British was so rapid and deadly that three
French brigades were almost wiped out of existence.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
Yet it is said that after this action the Hereditary Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
would never take British troops under his command
again.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> He admitted that General Waldegrave did
wonders in the combat,<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> but he complained of the
behaviour of his troops, though Waldegrave bore witness
that not a man retired until his ammunition was exhausted.
It may have been that the Prince was
irritated by the failure of the reserve to arrive when it
was wanted; but no blame is imputed to any one for this
mischance, which appears to have been due simply to
bad luck. Mauvillon, who is always very frank in his
criticism of the British, says flatly that he does not
believe in their misconduct on this occasion; and as
the only extant list of casualties, though very far from
complete, shows that they lost five hundred killed and
wounded, it should seem that the Prince's strictures
were ill deserved. It was hard, too, that he should have
forgotten all that they had done for him at Emsdorff and
at Warburg, to say nothing of the fact that the heroic
charge of the Fifteenth probably saved his force from
total destruction at Kloster Kampen itself. Whether
he himself should have hazarded such an action against
odds of two to one, with the French bringing up reinforcements
from the west, is another question; for it
was not as though the fall of Wesel were likely to ensue
speedily even if Castries were beaten, while the diversion
had proved to be no diversion whatever. On the other
hand, the destruction of his corps, or of the best part
of it, would have been a severe blow to Ferdinand.
Nevertheless the stake, if he should win it, was worth
winning; though if he could have foreseen what was
immediately before him he would probably have hesitated
to play so desperate a game.</p>

<div class="sidenote">October.</div>

<p>After the action he retreated northward to Büderich,
to find that the bridge which he had thrown over the
Rhine had been swept away by floods, and that he
could go no farther. His situation was now desperate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>for not only was his retreat cut off, but his ammunition
was exhausted. Still, wounded though he was, he faced
his difficulties with his usual energy, entrenched himself
among his waggons, reconstructed his bridge, and on
the 18th crossed the river unmolested, picking up the
troops from before Wesel on the eastern bank. Castries
followed him as he retreated eastward, thereby forcing
him to remain in Westphalia for the protection of
Lippstadt and Münster, though the Prince none the
less made shift to detach a portion of his force to the
assistance of Ferdinand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 15 and<br />
Nov. 3.</div>

<p>For to Ferdinand also the failure before Wesel was
a serious matter. Any further stroke upon the French
was impossible; and the utmost for which he could hope
was to drive them out of Hesse and to hold Westphalia
safe. He made an effort to expel the French from
Göttingen, but without success; and at last, driven to
desperation by three months of continuous rain, he
cantoned a force in winter-quarters before the town and
closed the campaign, leaving the French in possession
of Hesse, of the Principality of Göttingen, and of the
defiles of Münden, which gave them free ingress into
Hanover and Brunswick. His own headquarters were
fixed at Warburg; those of the French at Cassel.
Despite all his efforts, superior numbers had told heavily
against him; and though he had fired a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu de joie</i> for
the capture of Montreal, he probably found less consolation
in this than in the victories of his master Frederick
at Leignitz and Torgau, and in the expulsion of his
enemies' forces from Saxony.</p>

    </div>

<div class="sidenote">1760.</div>

<p class="noindent">Meanwhile on the 20th of November Parliament had
met to hear his first speech from a new king. For on
the 25th of October, just before the coming of the
news of Kloster Kampen, King George the Second had
died suddenly, having lived to see the glories of Queen
Anne's reign brought back by Pitt, and the fame of
Blenheim and Oudenarde revived not only by Minden
and Warburg but by Wandewash and Quebec. George
the Third struck a new and strange note in his speech
from the throne. "Born and educated in England,"
he said&mdash;and the words were of his own insertion&mdash;"I
glory in the name of Briton"; and the phrase fell
pleasantly on ears that did not love the sound of
Hanover; though what this sudden outburst of insular
patriotism on the King's part might portend to his
German allies was not yet revealed. The estimates for
the Army were passed with little difficulty, though the
Establishment showed a considerable increase. The new
regiments that appeared on the list, indeed, were few,
for a system had been initiated of raising an indefinite
number of independent companies; but these were
gradually combined into regiments, and before the
campaign opened there was already a corps numbered
the hundredth of the Line.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The total number of men
voted on the British Establishment was one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
and four thousand; besides which the embodied militia
was increased from eighteen to twenty-seven thousand,
making, together with the troops on the Irish Establishment,
over one hundred and forty thousand men raised
in the British possessions alone. Adding the mercenary
forces of Hanover, Hesse, and Brunswick, the number
of soldiers in British pay fell little short of two hundred
thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761.</div>

<p>Yet for the present no considerable reinforcement
was despatched to Ferdinand. A battalion from each
regiment of Guards had indeed been sent to him late
in the past campaign, together with the usual drafts to
fill up vacancies. But Pitt had another enterprise
in hand as a diversion in Ferdinand's favour. A scheme
of the kind had indeed been on the point of execution
in the autumn of 1760; and eight thousand men had
actually been embarked for a secret expedition under
General Kingsley, but had been returned to the shore on
receipt of the news of Kloster Kampen.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> In January,
however, the same regiments were again warned for
service under Major-General Hodgson,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> and on the
29th of March they sailed from Spithead under convoy
of ten ships of the line, besides smaller vessels, under
Admiral Keppel, for their unknown destination.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">April.<br />April 22.</div>

<p>On the 7th of April the fleet anchored off the island
of Belleisle on the French coast, and on the following
day sailed round it looking for an undefended point.
Finally Port La Maria on the south-eastern side was
selected; the troops were shifted into flat-bottomed
boats, and an attempt was made to storm some French
entrenchments which covered the landing-place. But
the ground was so steep that only sixty men of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>Thirty-seventh succeeded in making their way to the
top of the heights above the sea, and these after a
gallant attempt to hold their ground were overpowered
by superior numbers. The attempt was therefore
abandoned, and the troops were re-embarked, having
lost about five hundred men, killed, wounded, and taken.
The island was in fact so strong by nature, and so
skilfully fortified by art, that Keppel despaired of a
successful descent.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> The commanders, however, decided
that, if feint attacks were made on La Maria and Sauzon
some footing might be obtained by ascending the rocks
between them, which being judged inaccessible had
been left undefended. The attempt was accordingly
made on the 22nd and was brilliantly successful. The
grenadier-company of the Nineteenth contrived to
scramble up the rocks and to hold its own on the
summit until reinforced, when the men charged with
the bayonet, drove back the enemy and captured three
guns. The French then retired into the fortress of
Palais and proceeded to strengthen the defences; while
Hodgson, to his infinite mortification, was obliged to lie
idle for a fortnight, being unable to land his heavy
artillery owing to continual gales. At length on the
2nd of May ground was broken, and on the 13th the
entrenchments were carried by storm. The French
thereupon retired into the citadel, which after a most
gallant defence was compelled on the 7th of June to
surrender. The losses of the British throughout the
whole of the operations were about seven hundred
killed and wounded. Thus Belleisle was secured as a
place of refreshment for the fleet while engaged in the
weary work of blockading the French coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feb.</div>

<p>Any hopes that might have been built on the value
of this expedition as a help to Ferdinand were very
speedily dissipated. Ferdinand himself had sought, while
it was yet mid-winter, to make good the losses of the
past campaign by a bold stroke for the recapture of
Hesse. Moving out of his winter-quarters on the 11th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
of February he distributed his army into three columns.
The left or eastern column, under Spörcke, was designed
to march to the Werra and Unstrut, and to join with a
detachment of Prussians in an attack upon the Saxons
in that quarter; the main or central army, under
Ferdinand himself, was to march to the Eder; and the
right or westward column, which was composed of the
troops cantoned in Westphalia under the Hereditary
Prince, was to advance on Fritzlar, while a separate
corps was detached to attempt the capture of Marburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">March 20.<br />March 21.<br />March.</div>

<p>Spörcke for his part did his work well and gained a
brilliant little victory at Langensalza; but the rest of
the scheme went to wreck. Broglie on learning of
Ferdinand's movements left a garrison in Cassel and
retreated first to Hersfeld, behind the Eder, and finally
to the Main. But meanwhile the Hereditary Prince
had been delayed for two invaluable days by unexpected
resistance at Fritzlar; and Ferdinand, though he
had driven the enemy for the moment from Hesse, had
left Cassel, Ziegenhain, and Marburg, invested indeed
but untaken, behind him. He dared not linger to
master these places one after another, for the whole
country was laid waste, and the strain of hauling all
supplies from the Weser was intolerable. The road
from Beverungen to the central column of the army was
paved with dead horses, the corpses tracing the whole
line of the advance. He was therefore obliged to
hasten on to a district where supplies were still obtainable,
trusting that good fortune would throw the strong
places into his hands before it was too late. But it was
not to be. Broglie quickly concentrated his troops on
the Main, summoned twelve thousand men from the
Lower Rhine and advanced northward to Giessen;
whereupon Ferdinand, who had penetrated as far south
as the Ohm, was compelled to fall back to the Eder.
On the following day the Hereditary Prince was
attacked by superior numbers at Grünberg and compelled
to retreat with loss of two thousand prisoners;
and this misfortune neutralised all the advantages so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
far gained by the enterprise. Ferdinand, therefore,
raised the siege of Cassel and fell back with all speed
by forced marches; for Broglie had now eighty thousand
troops against his own twenty thousand. Arrived at
his old position to north of the Diemel he dispersed his
troops once more into winter-quarters. His stroke had
failed; and the operations are interesting chiefly as
exemplifying the futility, in those days of slow communication,
of an advance into an enemy's country, unless
at least one fortress were first captured as a place of
arms. It is easier to understand the reason for the
laborious sieges of Marlborough and Wellington when
it is observed that Ferdinand, though he drove the
French before him from end to end of Hesse in a few
weeks, was obliged to abandon the whole of it and to
retreat because he had left Cassel uncaptured in his rear.</p>

<p>The Allies had suffered so terribly from hardship
and exposure during this winter's expedition that it was
two months before they were again fit to take the field;<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
and the French, partly from the same cause, partly
owing to the magnitude of their preparations, needed
little less time than they. The Court of Versailles had,
in fact, resolved to make a gigantic effort and to close
the war forthwith by employment of an overwhelming
force. The army of the Rhine was raised to one
hundred thousand men, under the Prince of Soubise,
and that of the Main to sixty thousand men under
Broglie. Soubise was to advance from the Rhine against
Ferdinand early in May; thus forcing the Prince either
to abandon Westphalia, together with Münster and
Lippstadt, in order to gain time for recuperation of his
army, or to march with his troops, still weakened and
exhausted by the winter's campaign, to fight him. His
task in fact was simply to keep Ferdinand's army in
motion until Broglie's troops were refreshed, and ready
to advance either into Hanover or to Hameln on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
Weser. When Broglie thus occupied the attention of
Ferdinand, Soubise would find himself with a free hand
in a free field. The weak point of the plan was that
the two French armies were to act independently, and
that the stronger of them was entrusted to Soubise, an
incompetent commander but a favourite with Madame
de Pompadour. But in any case the outlook for
Ferdinand was formidable, since at the very most he
could muster but ninety-three thousand men against
one hundred and sixty thousand of the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">April.<br />May 14.</div>

<p>Soubise duly arrived at Frankfort on the 13th of
April and summoned Broglie to discuss matters with
him. Then, instead of taking the field early in May,
he remained motionless behind the Rhine on various
pretexts until the beginning of June. Further, he
determined, contrary to the advice given to him at
Versailles, to pursue operations to the south of the
Lippe, and between that river and the Ruhr, in order
to effect a junction with Broglie. The motives that
may have dictated this resolution are unknown; but it
was conjectured that he shrank from engaging so
formidable an adversary as Ferdinand without a colleague
to share the risk and responsibility. Meanwhile
Ferdinand, selecting the least exhausted of his troops,
sent a corps under the Hereditary Prince to Nottuln,
a little to the west of Münster, to watch Soubise, and
by great exertions contrived within ten weeks to render
both his army and his transport fit to take the field.
Soubise's army was known to be encumbered by a vast
train of baggage; one troop of Horse Guards, for
instance, with a strength of one hundred and forty men,
travelling with no fewer than twelve hundred horses
attached to it. So all the forage about Münster was
destroyed, the inhabitants and their herds being provided
for by the King's commissaries, and every step was
taken to embarrass the French in their advance to the
east.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June.<br />July 1-2.<br />July 3.<br />July 4.<br />July 6.</div>

<p>At length on the 13th of June Soubise crossed the
Rhine at Wesel, and arrived ten days later at Unna, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
few miles to eastward of Dortmund, where he entrenched
himself, with his front to the east. Ferdinand thereupon
concentrated his army on the 19th at Paderborn,
leaving twenty thousand men under Spörcke on the
Diemel to watch Broglie, and a smaller corps of observation
before Göttingen. On the 20th he marched
westward, and on the 28th encamped over against
Soubise, where he was joined by the corps of the
Hereditary Prince. Finding that the French position
was too formidable to be attacked, he determined on a
bold stroke, made a forced march of thirty hours round
Soubise's left flank by Camen, and appeared suddenly
at Dortmund full in his rear and across his line of
communication. The movement left Soubise free to
unite with Broglie; but this was rather an advantage
than otherwise to Ferdinand, since the two commanders
being on bad terms might neutralise each other, whereas
each of them independently was at the head of a
stronger army than Ferdinand's. On the 4th of July
Ferdinand advanced against the rear of Soubise's camp;
whereupon the French General at once moved on,
always with the Allies close at his heels, to Soest,
where Broglie came to concert with him the junction
of the two armies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 10.<br />July.</div>

<p>Broglie himself had on the 29th of June advanced
to the Diemel and obliged Spörcke to abandon Warburg
and to retreat, not without loss of part of his artillery.
He had then turned westward upon Paderborn, which
he had occupied, and thence to Soest, where his army
joined that of Soubise on the 10th of July. The joint
strength of the two armies at Soest, after deducting the
detachments made from both of them, was just about
one hundred thousand men. Ferdinand's force, after
the arrival of Spörcke, who had made his way to him
from the Diemel with all haste, amounted to no more
than sixty thousand men. Even with such odds
against him, however, Ferdinand stood firm, refusing
to cross to the north bank of the Lippe and abandon
Lippstadt, as the French commanders had hoped. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
was determined that they should fight him for Lippstadt;
and they, knowing their adversary, were not too eager
to hazard the venture.</p>

<p>After sundry small changes and shiftings of position
between the 7th and 11th of July Ferdinand made the
following dispositions. General von Spörcke with
about eight thousand men was left on the north bank
of the Lippe at Hersfeld, to watch Prince Xavier of
Saxony, who lay with a corps in the vicinity of Paderborn.
The main army was encamped on the south
bank of the Lippe, with its left resting on the river;
from whence the left wing extended to the village of
Kirchdünckern on the Ase, a brook impassable except
by bridges. Vellinghausen, Ferdinand's headquarters,
lay midway between the Ase and the Lippe at the foot
of a declivity called the Dünckerberg. From the
Lippe to Vellinghausen the ground was occupied by
Wutgenau's corps, of seven battalions and five squadrons,
all of them German troops. From Vellinghausen
to Kirchdünckern the heights were held by Granby's
corps, consisting of two battalions of British grenadiers,
the Fifth, Twelfth, Twenty-fourth and Thirty-seventh
Foot under Brigadier Sandford, Keith's and Campbell's
Highlanders, six foreign battalions, the Greys, Seventh
and Eleventh Dragoons in one brigade under General
Harvey, and eight foreign squadrons, together with
a regiment of Hanoverian artillery. From the Ase
the position was prolonged to the right along a similar
line of heights by the villages of Sud Dünckern and
Wambeln to the rear of Werle at Budberg, the whole
of the front being covered by a marshy brook called
the Salzbach. From the Ase to Wambeln the ground
was occupied by Anhalt's corps of ten German battalions
and the First, Sixth, and Tenth British Dragoons; to
the right of Anhalt stood Conway's corps, of three
battalions of British Guards with their grenadiers massed
into a fourth battalion, Townsend's brigade of the
Eighth, Twentieth, Twenty-fifth, and Fiftieth Foot,
and the First, Third, and Seventh Dragoon Guards; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
the right of Conway stood Howard's corps, consisting
of Cavendish's brigade of the Eleventh, Twenty-fifth,
Twenty-third, and Fifty-first Foot, two German
battalions, the British light batteries and two brigades
of Hessian artillery; and finally the extreme right
from Wambeln to Hilbeck was held by the Hereditary
Prince's corps of twenty-five battalions and twenty-four
squadrons of Germans. The Salzbach was an
obstacle well-nigh insuperable, the only passage by
which the French could cross it being by the village
of Scheidingen, opposite to Conway's corps, where an
old redoubt, dating from the days of Turenne, still
remained to bar the way. The weak point of the
position was its right flank which, though more or less
protected by marshy ground, lay practically in the air,
and could have been turned with little difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 15.</div>

<p>The plan of the French commanders, though it
took no advantage of this defect, was not ill conceived.
Broglie was to attack the corps of Wutgenau and
Granby, but particularly that of Granby between the
Lippe and the Ase, with his whole force; while Soubise
kept the rest of the Allies distracted by an attack on
Scheidingen, at the same time sending a cloud of light
troops round the right flank of the Allies to Hamm,
five miles in their rear, so as to create confusion and
embarrass their retreat. The attack was fixed for the
13th but was deferred for two days; and it was not
until the evening of the 15th that Ferdinand was
apprised of the advance of the French in force against
his left. For some reason Wutgenau's corps had been
encamped a thousand yards in rear of its position in
the line of battle; and although it had received orders
at noon, in consequence of suspicious movements by the
French, to strike tents and march forward, yet this order
had been cancelled. Thus Broglie's attack came upon
it as a complete surprise. Granby's corps had only just
time to seize its arms and turn out, leaving the tents
standing; the Highlanders indeed hardly emerging
from their tents before the French guns opened fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
on them. Yet there was no confusion, and Granby's
dispositions were so good that he was able to hold his
own till Wutgenau's troops came up. The two corps
then made a fine defence until darkness put an end to
the combat; but none the less the French had succeeded
in taking Nordel, a village on Granby's right front,
and had made good their footing in Vellinghausen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Soubise had not yet moved forward
against Scheidingen. The time fixed by the Marshals
for their decisive attack has been, in fact, the early hours
of the 16th, so that Broglie's advance had been premature.
He excused himself by saying that he had intended
only to drive in the outposts of the Allies, but that he
had been encouraged by his unexpected success to bring
forward more troops to hold the ground that he had
gained, and that he had accordingly appealed to Soubise
to hasten his movements likewise. Had Broglie really
pushed his attack home he would probably have succeeded,
for the Allies were too weak to stop him and
were, moreover, short of ammunition. But the Marshal
was too timid a man to take responsibility on his own
shoulders; so instead of making a bold attempt to carry
the Dünckerberg, which if successful must have forced
Ferdinand to retreat, he stopped short at Vellinghausen,
leaving the Allies in their position unmoved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 16.</div>

<p>The night passed uneasily in the Allied camp.
Between the Lippe and the Ase skirmishing never
ceased. The road to Hamm was full of waggons going
and returning with loads of ammunition; Anhalt's
corps, together with all the British of Howard's corps,
was streaming across the Ase to reinforce Granby;
and Conway's and the Hereditary Prince's were extending
themselves leftward to cover the ground thus left
vacant. For Ferdinand knew Broglie to be his most
dangerous antagonist, and was determined to stop him
at all costs by fresh troops. Broglie, on his side, was
equally busy replacing the battalions that had already
been engaged; and the dawn was no sooner come
than his columns deployed and attacked in earnest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
The ground was so much broken up by hedges and
ditches that in many places the troops engaged, though
no more than one hundred and fifty yards apart, were
unable to see each other, and fired furiously, not without
destructive effect, at every puff of smoke that
betrayed an enemy's presence. From four until eight
o'clock this fusillade continued, neither side gaining or
losing an inch of ground, until at last it slackened from
the sheer exhaustion of the men, after more than twelve
hours of intermittent action.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Broglie looked anxiously for Soubise's
demonstration against the Allied centre and right, but
he looked in vain. Soubise, though he did indeed
bring forward troops against Scheidingen, made but a
faint attack, often renewed with unchangeable feebleness
and as often repulsed. Then after half an hour's
respite, the fire opened again on the Allied left. Spörcke
had detached six battalions to Wutgenau from Hersfeld;
and the arrival of fresh troops infused new life into the
engagement. Broglie too showed symptoms of reviving
energy, for two French batteries were observed in
motion towards a height opposite the Dünckerberg, from
which they might have made havoc of Granby's corps.
Ferdinand ordered that the height should be carried at
all costs; and Maxwell's grenadiers, Keith's and Campbell's
Highlanders and four foreign battalions advanced
forthwith to storm it. The French were so much
exhausted that they appear hardly to have awaited the
attack. They broke and fled precipitately, abandoning
their dead, their wounded, and several guns. Maxwell's
grenadiers alone made four battalions prisoners; and
Broglie, disheartened by his failure and by the apathy of
Soubise, gave the word to retreat. The ground was too
much broken for the action of cavalry; so he was able
to draw off his troops with little loss indeed, but not
without shame and disgrace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>Thus ended the battle of Vellinghausen, one of the
feeblest ever fought by the French army. The losses
were not great on either side for the numbers engaged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
Those of the French were reckoned at from five to six
thousand men, besides eight colours and nineteen guns;
those of the Allies did not reach the figure of sixteen
hundred men, of whom over nine-tenths belonged to
the corps to the north of the Ase. The brunt of the
fighting fell of course on Granby's troops; but the
casualties of the British with him little exceeded four
hundred men, while those of the British in other parts
of the field did not amount to fifty. The victory was
in fact trifling except for its moral effects; but these
were sufficient. The French were humbled at the
failure of a hundred thousand men against fifty thousand;
and Broglie and Soubise, who had left the camp with
embraces, returned to it sworn enemies, each bitterly
reproaching the other for the loss of the battle. Lastly,
Broglie, who possessed some military talent and had
hitherto been anxious to bring his enemy to action,
came to the conclusion that a general engagement with
Ferdinand was a thing henceforth not to be courted but
to be shunned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 27.<br />August.<br />Aug. 16.<br />Aug. 22.<br />Aug. 28.</div>

<p>The remainder of the campaign is reckoned to be
the finest example of Ferdinand's skill as a general; but
it is impossible in this place to sketch it in more than
the faintest outline. After the action, Soubise made up
Broglie's army to forty thousand men, and therewith the
two commanders separated; Broglie marching on Paderborn
for operations against Hanover and Hesse, while
Soubise made for Wesel to threaten Westphalia. The
Hereditary Prince was detached to follow Soubise and
to harass his rear-guard, while Ferdinand marched some
thirty miles eastward to Büren, to be ready to move
into Hesse and threaten Broglie's communications with
Frankfort. At the same time Granby's corps was sent
forward to Stadtberg, to drive back a French corps
under Stainville, which covered Hesse at the line of the
Diemel. At Büren Ferdinand remained, with his eye
always on Lippstadt, until the 10th of August; when,
Stainville having been forced back to Cassel and Soubise
to the Rhine, both at a safe distance from the precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
fortress on the Lippe, he marched away to keep watch
over Broglie's army. That officer had used his time to
advance to Höxter, aiming at the capture of Hameln
and the mastery of the line of the Weser, and had
detached a corps under Prince Xavier of Saxony into
the Principality of Göttingen. Ferdinand by swift
marches brought his army to northward of Broglie's at
Reilenkirchen, thus heading him back from Hameln;
while a separate corps, which he had sent across the
Weser, attacked the French detachments about Göttingen.
The Hereditary Prince, finding nothing to fear
from Soubise, also returned from the Rhine to threaten
Broglie from the south. The Marshal thereupon crossed
the Weser; and Ferdinand, for all his unwillingness
to move to the east bank of the river, perforce followed
him; carefully avoiding an engagement, however, lest
Soubise should seize the opportunity to march on
Lippstadt. Soubise, finding himself unwatched, moved
eastward again towards Hanover; whereupon the
Hereditary Prince flew back to look after him, and
Ferdinand retiring with the rest of the army to the
Diemel, advanced against Broglie's communications with
Marburg and Frankfort. This movement brought
Broglie back hurriedly to Cassel; whereupon Ferdinand
retired quietly to Geismar on the Diemel, having accomplished
his object of occupying Broglie's attention for
weeks and of rendering his movements absolutely
purposeless, without the risk of an action.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 20.</div>

<p>It was a whole fortnight before Broglie ventured to
return to the east side of the Weser, having meanwhile
reinforced Stainville's army for the protection of Hesse,
and furnished him with most careful instructions for his
guidance. No sooner was the Marshal's back turned,
than Ferdinand made a sudden dash upon Stainville just
to south of the Diemel, and though he failed to inflict
any great damage on him, forced him to retire to Cassel
and brought Broglie back in all haste from Hanover.
Meanwhile the lethargic Soubise had made a diversion
towards the sea, had actually taken Emden, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
threatening Bremen. The Hereditary Prince was as
usual despatched to hunt him back to the Rhine; and
Ferdinand's communications with Holland were restored.</p>

<div class="sidenote">October 10.</div>

<p>There still remained some weeks, however, before
the campaign could be closed; and Broglie, despite all
Ferdinand's activity, was strong enough to detach a corps
under Prince Xavier into Brunswick, which captured
Wolfenbüttel and bade fair to capture Brunswick itself.
The loss of these two fortresses would have been serious,
since the French could have turned them into bases of
operations for the next campaign, when Ferdinand
would have found it impossible to attend both to
Brunswick and to Lippstadt. He therefore hastened
northward at once from the Diemel to save his brother's
capital; whereupon Prince Xavier, though Ferdinand
had travelled no further than Hameln on his way, at
once withdrew from before Brunswick and evacuated
Wolfenbüttel. Much relieved at the news of this
deliverance, Ferdinand halted at Hameln until November,
when Soubise went into winter-quarters. He then
made a final effort to drive Broglie from the eastern
bank of the Weser, but succeeded only in thrusting him
back for a short distance from his northernmost post at
Einbeck. Broglie then went into winter-quarters along
the Leine from Göttingen to Nordheim, and the Allies
followed his example; their chain of posts running
from Münster along the line of the Lippe and Diemel,
and eastward through the Sollinger Forest to Ferdinand's
headquarters at Hildesheim.</p>

<p>So ended this most arduous campaign, in which,
though overmatched by two to one, Ferdinand had
won a victory on the battlefield and lost little or no
territory. The exertion demanded from his troops by
incessant and severe marches told heavily upon their
efficiency, and the more so since many of the men had
been already much weakened by the winter's campaign
in Hesse. The waste of the army was in fact appalling,
amounting to no fewer than five-and-twenty thousand
out of ninety-five thousand men. Of these some few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
had been killed in action, considerably more had deserted,
still more had been invalided, and fully one-half had
died of hardship and disease. It was only at such a
price that Ferdinand could make one army do the work
of two; and the task would have been beyond even his
ability had not one of the commanders matched against
him been utterly incompetent, and the other hampered
by constant interference from Versailles. The extreme
laxity of discipline among the French also helped him
not a little, and served to heighten the moral superiority
of his own troops. But, making all such allowance in
his favour, the campaign remains memorable in the
annals of war for the consummate skill with which
Ferdinand kept two armies, jointly of double his
strength, continually in motion for six months, without
permitting them to reap the slightest advantage from
their operations.</p>

<p class="noindent">Before the campaign closed in Germany, the great
Minister who had revealed to England for the first
time the plenitude of her strength in arms, and had
turned that strength to such mighty enterprises, was
fallen from power. The accession of the new King had
brought with it a steady increase in the ascendency of
John, Earl of Bute, long a trusted member of his
household and now his chief adviser and friend.
Blameless in private life and by no means lacking in
culture or accomplishments, Bute was both in council
and debate a man of distressing mediocrity. Possessing
neither sense of the ridiculous nor knowledge of his own
limitations, and exalted by mere accident to a position
of great influence, he interpreted the caprice of fortune
as the reward of merit and aimed at once at the highest
office. He was, in fact, one of the many men who,
finding it no great exertion to climb up the winding
stairs of a cathedral tower, press on, ducking, stooping,
and crawling to the top, to find when they reach it
that they dare not look down. Being weak as well
as ambitious he was compelled to fall back on intrigue
in default of ability to help him upward, and having
succeeded in displacing Lord Holderness as Secretary of
State in March 1761, he turned next to the ousting
of Pitt himself. The opportunity soon came. The
French Court, weary of the war, approached Pitt with
proposals for peace. Resolved, as he said, that no
Peace of Utrecht should again sully the annals of
England, Pitt not only made large demands for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
benefit of Britain, but insisted that even a separate peace
between Britain and France should not deter King
George from giving aid to the King of Prussia.
Curiously enough the negotiation was broken off owing
precisely to one of the most disgraceful concessions
made at the Peace of Utrecht. The Bourbon King of
Spain, Charles the Third, who had succeeded to the throne
in 1759, cultivated the friendship of the Bourbon King
of France; and the result was a secret treaty of alliance
between them, which presently became famous as the
Family Compact. Pitt no sooner obtained an inkling
of this agreement than he put an end to negotiations
with France, and advocated immediate declaration of
war against Spain. As shall presently be seen, he made
his preparations, which were effective enough; but
above all he desired to strike at Spain while she was still
unready for war. The Cabinet, however, was alarmed
at so bold a measure, being too blind to see that in such
a case aggression is the truest precaution. Many of
the ministry had only with difficulty been persuaded to
second Pitt in the lofty language which he had held
towards France; and Bute, who abhorred all interference
with affairs on the Continent, was a leader among
the dissentients. Lord Temple alone stood by his
great chief, so Pitt, unable to prevail, resigned, and his
solitary supporter with him. All power passed into the
hands of Bute; and within three months Spain, having
gained the time that she needed for her military
preparations, assumed so offensive a tone that Bute,
as Pitt had predicted, was to his huge vexation
obliged to declare war against her himself. Such is
the fashion in which politicians make difficulties for
generals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761.<br />June.</div>

<p>Fortunately the designs of Pitt for the new year
against both France and Spain were fully matured, and
the means of executing them were ready to hand. In
June 1761 two new regiments<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> had been either raised
or formed out of existing independent companies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
and thirteen more had been added in August and
October,<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> thus bringing the number of regiments of the
Line up to one hundred and fifteen. The total number
of men voted by Parliament for 1762 was little short of
one hundred and fifty thousand men, making with the
German mercenaries a total of two hundred and fifteen
thousand men in British pay. There were thus men in
abundance for any enterprise; and the sphere of operations
had been marked out by Pitt. The conquest of
Canada having been completed by the end of 1760,
there was no object in leaving a large number of troops
unemployed in America; and as early as in January
1761 Pitt had written to Amherst that some of them
would be required in the autumn for the conquest of
Dominica, St. Lucia, and Martinique. Amherst was
therefore instructed to send two thousand men forthwith
to Guadeloupe; to concert with the Governor the
means of taking the two first of the islands mentioned;
and to despatch six thousand more men rather later in
the year for the capture of Martinique.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Accordingly
in the first days of June 1761 transports from America
began to drop singly into Guadeloupe, the fleet having
been dispersed by a storm. By the 3rd of June four
ships had arrived, together with Lord Rollo, who had
been appointed by Amherst to take the command; and
on the following day the whole of these, together with
one ship more from Guadeloupe itself, made sail under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>escort of Sir J. Douglas's squadron to beat back against
the trade-wind to Dominica.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> By noon of the 6th they
had arrived before Roseau, where the inhabitants were
summoned to surrender. The French replied by
manning their batteries and other defences, which
included four separate lines of entrenchments, ranged
one above another. Rollo landed his men and entered
the town; when reflecting that the enemy might be
reinforced in the night he resolved, though it was
already late, to storm the entrenchments forthwith. He
attacked accordingly, and drove out the French in
confusion with trifling loss to himself. The French
commander and his second being both taken prisoners,
no further resistance was made; and on the following
day Dominica swore allegiance to King George.</p>

<p>Therewith the operations in the West Indies for the
time ceased, though the preparations continued always;
but, notwithstanding all possible secrecy, the French in
Martinique got wind of the intended attack on that
island, and took measures for their defence. Their
force was not wholly contemptible in so mountainous a
country, for it included twelve hundred regular troops,
seven thousand local militia, and four thousand hired
privateersmen.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> The neighbouring English islands did
what they could to help the mother country. Antigua
sent negroes and part of her old garrison, the Thirty-eighth
Foot, which had never left her since Queen
Anne's day; and Barbados raised five hundred negroes
and as many white men, which were the more acceptable
since that island was, as usual, the rendezvous for the
expedition.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The first troops to arrive in Carlisle Bay
were a detachment from Belleisle,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> where, as well as
in America, regiments had been lying idle; and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>Christmas Eve appeared the main army from America
under command of General Monckton. This was
made up of eleven different regiments,<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> besides a few
companies of American rangers. In all, the force entrusted
to Monckton must have amounted to fully
eight thousand men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762.<br />January.<br />Jan. 24.</div>

<p>On the 5th of January the transports weighed
anchor and sailed away to leeward, under escort of
Admiral Rodney's fleet, past the Pitons of St. Lucia,
past the port of Castries and the bay which Rodney was
twenty years later to make famous, and on the 7th
anchored in St. Ann's Bay, just round the southern
extremity of Martinique, on the western side. Two
brigades were then landed in the Anse d'Arlet, a bay
farther up the western coast, from which they marched
to the south of the bay that forms the harbour of Fort
Royal, but, finding the road impracticable for transport
of cannon, were re-embarked. On the 16th the entire
army was landed without loss of a man at Case Navire,
a little to the north of Negro Point. This Point forms
the northern headland of the harbour, and had at its
foot a road leading due east over the mountains to the
capital town of Fort Royal,<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> some three miles away.
The way was blocked by deep gullies and ravines; while
the French had erected redoubts at every point of
vantage, as well as batteries on a hill beyond, named
Morne Tortenson. Monckton was thus compelled to
erect batteries to silence the French guns before he
could advance farther. By the 24th this work was
complete, and at daybreak a general attack was made
under the fire of the batteries upon the French defences
on Morne Tortenson, a party being at the same time
detached to turn the enemy's right flank. The turning
movement was completely successful; and the redoubts
by the sea, on the enemy's left, having been carried,
the troops stormed post after post, until at nine o'clock
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>they were in possession not only of the detached redoubts
but of the entire position of Morne Tortenson,
with its guns and entrenchments. The French retired
in great confusion, some to Fort Royal and some to
Morne Grenier, a still higher hill to the north of
Morne Tortenson. Simultaneously two brigades under
Brigadiers Haviland and Walsh attacked other French
posts to the north of Morne Tortenson and, after great
difficulty owing to the steepness of the ground,
succeeded in driving them also back to Morne Grenier.
The losses of the British in this action amounted to
thirty-three officers and three hundred and fifty men
killed and wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 25.</div>

<p>On the following day Monckton, being now within
range, began to throw up batteries against the citadel of
Fort Royal, but finding himself much annoyed by the
French batteries on Morne Grenier to his left, decided
that these must first be silenced. Fortunately the enemy
saved him from further trouble by taking the offensive.
On the afternoon of the 27th they suddenly debouched
in three columns from Morne Grenier upon Haviland's
brigade and the Light Infantry of the army, on
Monckton's left, and with unexpected temerity ventured
to attack. Unhappily for them, one column exposed its
flank to the Highlanders and was almost instantly
routed. The two remaining columns thereupon gave
way, and the whole fled back to Morne Grenier with
the British in eager chase. Such was the impetuosity of
the pursuers that they plunged down into the intervening
ravine after the French, and swarming up Morne
Grenier "by every path, road, and passage where men
could run, walk, or creep,"<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> hunted the fugitives headlong
before them. Night came on, but the British officers
would not stop until they had cleared every Frenchman
off the hill and captured all the works and cannon.
Monckton at once sent off more troops to support the
pursuers, and by one o'clock in the morning of the 28th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
Morne Grenier was securely occupied, at a cost of little
more than one hundred British killed and wounded.
The batteries on Morne Tortenson were then completed,
new batteries were constructed within four
hundred yards of the citadel, and on the 3rd of
February Fort Royal surrendered. Nine days more
sufficed to reduce the rest of the Island, and by the 12th
of February Monckton's work was done.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Feb. 26-<br />March 3.<br />June.</div>

<p>He at once shipped off detachments to St. Lucia,
Grenada, and St. Vincent, which islands fell without
resistance, and had made his arrangements for the
capture of Tobago also, when he received orders
requiring the presence of his troops elsewhere. War
had been declared against Spain; Lord Albemarle had
been appointed to command an expedition against
Havanna; and Amherst had been directed not only to
embark four thousand men from America to join him,
but to collect eight thousand more for an attack on
Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The stroke meditated by Pitt three months
before was now about to fall. In February 1762 Albemarle's
troops embarked; and on the 5th of March he
sailed with four regiments only,<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> under convoy of
Admiral Sir George Pocock, to pick up the remainder
of his forces in the West Indies. On the 20th of
April he arrived at Barbados, and on the 25th at Fort
Royal, Martinique, where he took over from Monckton
what he termed "the remains of a very fine army,"
much reduced by sickness, which brought his force to a
strength of twelve thousand men of all ranks.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Thence
continuing his voyage he came on the 6th of June
into sight of Havanna. Twelve sail of the line were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>detached to the mouth of the harbour to block in the
Spanish fleet, and on the following day the troops were
landed safely a little to the northward of the city.
On the 8th the army advanced westward, brushing
away a force of militia that stood in its path, and on
the same day arrived before the principal defences of
Havanna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>The entrance to the harbour of Havanna lies through
a channel about two hundred yards wide, which was
defended by two forts at its mouth, Fort Moro on the
northern shore, and Fort Puntal opposite to it, the
town also being situated on the southern shore. On
the north side the ground rises rather abruptly from the
harbour into a ridge known as the Cavannos, at the end
of which stands Fort Moro, abutting on the open sea.
A detached redoubt on these heights was carried without
difficulty on the 11th of June, and, Fort Moro
being found after reconnaissance to be surrounded with
impenetrable brushwood, the construction of a battery
was begun under cover of the trees. The work progressed
slowly, for the soil was thin, while the Spanish
ships in the harbour caused the besiegers no slight
annoyance; so on the 13th a part of the British force
was landed at Chorera, on the other side of the harbour.
It was not until July that the British batteries could
open a really effective fire, but by the 15th, with the
help of the fleet, the enemy's guns were for the time
silenced; and since trenches were impossible in ground
so rocky, approaches to Fort Moro were made of
gabions and cotton-bales. Still the work made little
progress, for the climate had begun to tell on the troops,
and little more than half of the men were fit for duty.
Meanwhile the garrison of Fort Moro continued to
defend itself with the greatest obstinacy, due in part to
its confidence in the strength of the fort. The ditch
at the point of attack was seventy feet deep from the
edge of the counterscarp, except in one place, where a
narrow ridge of rock made it possible to reach the wall
of the fort without scaling-ladders. The only way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
surmount such an obstacle was to sink a shaft and blow
the counterscarp into the ditch, but powder was already
running short; and Albemarle grew extremely anxious
over the issue of his operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 30.</div>

<p>At length on the 27th Colonel Burton arrived from
America with three thousand men of the Forty-sixth,
Fifty-eighth, Gorham's rangers and Provincial troops,
having lost five hundred men captured by the French
on the voyage. Three days later the mine under the
counterscarp was sprung with success, and Fort Moro
was carried by storm with trifling loss, the Spaniards
offering but little resistance. New batteries were then
pushed forward along the shore at the foot of the
Cavannos in order to play on the town. On the 10th
of August these opened fire and on the same evening
silenced Fort Puntal. The Spaniards then proposed a
capitulation; and Albemarle, in consideration of their
defence, granted them the honours of war, being in
truth devoutly thankful to obtain possession of Havanna
on any terms. His army was melting away rapidly
from disease; there was indeed one brigade of four
battalions which could not muster twenty men fit for
duty. Albemarle hastened to ship it back to America;
but Amherst could spare no more troops to replace
these, having already reduced his garrison to a strength
of less than four thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Albemarle hoped
that rest and better quarters might restore the health
of the army after the work of the siege was done; but
on the contrary sickness increased. The losses actually
caused by the enemy's fire during the siege were rather
less than a thousand men killed and wounded, yet by
the 18th of October the British had buried over five
thousand men dead from sickness alone.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Nor did the
transfer of the troops from Cuba to America serve to
abate the plague among them; for the hapless brigade
first shipped off by Albemarle lost three hundred and
sixty men within a month after its return. Yet at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>rate Cuba was taken, and Cuba in those days was
reckoned a prize little less rich than India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 27.<br />Sept. 18.</div>

<p>The virtual destruction of the army before Havanna
put all ideas of an attack on Louisiana out of the
question; and the French seized the opportunity offered
by the removal of so many troops from Canada to send
a small squadron and fifteen hundred troops against
Newfoundland. The British garrison being only one
hundred strong could offer no resistance, and the island
was accordingly surrendered. Amherst, however, sent
his brother with a sufficient force to recover it; and the
French after a short defence capitulated as prisoners
of war. As Amherst's losses did not exceed fifty men,
and the captured French garrison numbered six hundred,
the enemy gained little by this brief occupation of
Newfoundland.</p>

<p>But in India also there were troops lying idle since
the fall of Pondicherry, which could be employed
against Spain. In June Admiral Cornish received
secret orders for an expedition, which he communicated
to the authorities at Calcutta; and on the 1st of August
the fleet sailed away to eastward with a force of one
thousand Europeans, half of them of Draper's regiment,
and two thousand Sepoys, under General Draper. On
the 24th of September, after much delay owing to
stormy weather and the extremely defective condition of
Cornish's ships, the expedition entered the bay of
Manila and anchored off Fort Cavita. Draper decided
not to waste time in reducing the fort, so landed his
troops unopposed on the following day through a heavy
surf, about a mile and a half from the walls of the city.
On the 26th he seized a detached fort which had been
abandoned by the Spaniards within two hundred yards
of the glacis, and began to construct a battery, while
the ships sailed up to draw the fire of the town upon
themselves. On the 30th a storeship arrived with
entrenching tools, but was driven ashore on the very
same evening by a gale, and there lay hard and fast.
By singular good fortune, however, she had taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
ground at a point where she served exactly to screen the
rear of Draper's camp from the Spanish cannon, while
her stores were landed with greater speed and safety
than would have been possible had she remained afloat;
for the gale continued for several days and forbade the
passage of boats through the surf. Four days later the
battery and the ships opened a furious fire, which in four
hours silenced the enemy's guns, and by the next day
had made a practicable breach. That night the Spaniards
made a sally upon the British position with a thousand
Indians, who, despite their ferocity and daring, were
driven back with heavy loss; and at dawn of the 6th
Draper's regiment and a party of sailors attacked the
breach and carried the fortifications with little difficulty.
Thereupon Manila, with the island of Luzon and its
dependencies, surrendered to the British, paying four
million dollars for ransom of the town and of the
property contained therein. Thus fell Manila within
ten days of the arrival of the British; but the siege
though short was attended by much difficulty and
hardship. Regular approaches were impracticable owing
to the incessant rain; while the surf made the landing
of troops and stores a matter of extreme labour and
peril. Had not the defences of the town been for the
most part feeble and the spirit of the garrison feebler
still, the capture of the Philippines would have been no
such simple matter. The story of Manila is, however,
interesting as a comment on Wentworth's proceedings
at Carthagena, justifying to the full Vernon's predilection
for a direct assault at the earliest possible moment
in all operations against the Spaniard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aug. 26.</div>

<p>Yet another expedition brought the British face to
face with their new enemy on more familiar ground than
Luzon. The Spaniards, on the pretext of Portuguese
friendship with England, in April invaded Portugal,
overran the country as far as the Douro from the north,
and threw another force against Almeida from the east.
The injured kingdom appealed to England for help;
and in May orders were sent to Belleisle for the despatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
of four regiments of infantry,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> together with the detachment
of the Sixteenth Light Dragoons, to Portugal. Two
more regiments were added from Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> bringing the
total up to about seven thousand men; and simultaneously
a number of British officers were sent to take
up commands in the Portuguese army. Unfortunately
there was some trouble over the selection of a commander;
and though the two regiments from Ireland
were actually in the Tagus by the first week in May, it
was not until June that the rest of the troops arrived,
with the Count of Lippe-Bückeburg, the famous artillerist,
as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces, and
Lord Loudoun in command of the British. The
operations that followed were so trifling and of so short
duration that they are unworthy of detailed mention.
The Spaniards captured Almeida early in August; and
Bückeburg was obliged to stand on the defensive and
cover Lisbon at the line of the Tagus. Two brilliant
little affairs, however, served to lift an officer, who so
far was little known, into a prominence which was one
day to be disastrous to himself and to England. This
was Brigadier-General John Burgoyne, Colonel of the
Sixteenth Light Dragoons, who with four hundred
troopers of his regiment surprised the town of Valencia
de Alcantara after a forced march of forty-five miles,
annihilated a regiment of Spanish infantry and captured
several prisoners. Not content with this, he a month
later surprised the camp of another party of Spaniards
at Villa Velha, on the south bank of the Tagus, dispersed
it with considerable loss and captured six guns,
at a cost of but one man killed and ten wounded.
Such affairs, which in Ferdinand's army were so common
as seldom to be noticed, made Burgoyne and the
Sixteenth<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> the heroes of this short campaign; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>though the regiment has lived the rest of its life according
to this beginning, Burgoyne's career will end for us
twenty years hence at Saratoga.</p>

<p>From these scattered enterprises against Spain I
return to Ferdinand's last campaign against the old
enemy in Germany. We left the contending parties in
their winter-quarters, the French army of the Rhine
cantoned along the river from Cleve to Cologne; the
army of the Main extending from Altenkirchen, a little
to north of Treves, north-eastward to Cassel and from
Cassel south-eastward to Langensalza; and the Allies,
facing almost due south, stretched from Münster to
Halberstadt. The whole situation was, however, changed
in various respects. The French had resolved to throw
their principal strength into the army of the Main,
which was accordingly raised to eighty thousand men
under the command of Soubise and Marshal d'Estrées;
Broglie having been recalled to France. The army of
the Rhine was reduced proportionately to thirty thousand
men under the Prince of Condé. The total
numbers of the French, though less than in previous
years, still remained far superior to Ferdinand's; but,
on the other hand, owing to the change of ministry in
England and the reopening of negotiations by Bute, the
Court of Versailles was content to hold the ground
already gained without attempt at further conquest.
Soubise and d'Estrées were therefore instructed to cling
fast to Cassel and Göttingen, to spare the district
between the Rhine and the Lahn with a view to winter-quarters,
and to destroy the forage between the Eder
and the Diemel so as to prevent Ferdinand from
manœuvring on their flanks and rear.</p>

<p>Ferdinand on his side, though still outmatched by
the armies opposed to him, was relatively stronger in
numbers than in any previous year, having a nominal
total of ninety-five thousand men ready for the field.
Winter-quarters were little disturbed during the early
months of 1762, the country having been so much devastated
that neither side could move, from lack of forage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
until the green corn was already grown high. Towards
the end of May both armies began to concentrate; and
Ferdinand, though much delayed by the negligence of
the British Ministry in recruiting the British regiments to
their right strength, determined to be first in the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 18.<br />June 22.</div>

<p>Having detached a strong corps under the Hereditary
Prince to watch the movements of Condé, he
concentrated at Brakel, a little to the east of Paderborn,
and advanced to the Diemel, where he posted the main
army about Corbeke, with Granby's corps to westward
of it at Warburg. Hearing at the same time that the
French had left a corps under Prince Xavier on the east
of the Weser to invade Hanover, he detached General
Lückner with a small force across the river to keep
an eye on him, sending also parties to seize the Castle
of Zappaburg, some few miles to south-east, to secure
communications with Lückner, and to occupy the passes
leading from the south of the Diemel into Hesse.
Meanwhile, on the 22nd of June, Soubise and d'Estrées
moved northward from Cassel with the main body of
the army as far as Gröbenstein, fixed their headquarters
at Wilhelmsthal and halted. The design of
this movement is unintelligible unless, as is conjectured
by one writer,<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> they wished simply to amuse themselves
at the castle of Wilhelmsthal; but in any case they
neglected all necessary precautions. Their right flank
rested on the large forest known as the Reinhardswald,
and might have been rendered absolutely secure by the
occupation of the Zappaburg, which commanded every
road through that forest; yet they had suffered this
important post to fall into Ferdinand's hands. Again,
the occupation of the passes to the south of the Diemel
would have secured their front; but here also they had
allowed the Allies to be before them. None the less
there they remained, careless of all consequences, at
Wilhelmsthal; while to tempt an active enemy still
farther, they stationed a corps under M. de Castries
before their right front at Carlsdorff, in absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
isolation from their main body. Ferdinand saw his
opportunity, and though he could bring but fifty
thousand men against their seventy thousand, resolved
to strike at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 23.</div>

<p>On the 23rd he recalled Lückner from across the
Weser to Gottesbühren, a little to the north of the
Zappaburg; and on hearing of his safe arrival at eight
o'clock of the same evening, ordered the whole army
to be under arms at midnight. For Lückner's corps
was but one of the toils which he was preparing to
draw around the unsuspecting French; and the places
for the rest had already been chosen. Spörcke, with
twelve battalions of Hanoverians and several squadrons,
was to advance from the left of the main body, turn a
little to the eastward upon Humme after crossing the
Diemel, and, marching from thence southward, was to
fall upon the right flank and rear of Castries' corps at
Hombrechsen. Lückner, with six battalions and seven
squadrons, was to march south-west from Gottesbühren
through the Zappaburg to Udenhausen, and form up to
the left of Spörcke on Castries' right rear. Colonel
Riedesel was to push forward from the Zappaburg with
a body of irregulars to Hohenkirch, on the south and
left of Lückner. Meanwhile Ferdinand was to advance
with the main body in five columns between Liebenau
and Sielen, upon the front of the French principal
army, while Granby should move south upon Zierenberg
and fall upon its left flank. Supposing that every
corps fulfilled its duty exactly in respect of time and
place, there was good hope that the entire force of the
French might be destroyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June 24.</div>

<p>Riedesel and Lückner were punctually in their
appointed places at seven o'clock on the morning of
the 24th. Spörcke's two columns, on emerging from
the Reinhardswald at five o'clock, found only two
vedettes before them on the heights of Hombrechsen,
and ascended those heights unopposed. Then, however,
not seeing Castries' corps, which, as it chanced, was
hidden from them by a wood, they turned to their left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
instead of to their right, and advanced unconsciously
towards the front of the French main army. The
startled vedettes galloped back to give the alarm; and
Castries hurriedly calling his men to arms prepared to
retreat. Pushing forward his cavalry right and left to
screen his movements from Spörcke and from Riedesel,
Castries quickly set his infantry in order for march;
and having contrived to hold Spörcke at bay for an
hour, began his retreat upon Wilhelmsthal and Cassel.
Lückner came up as he had been bidden at Udenhausen,
but meeting part of Spörcke's corps on its march in
the wrong direction was fired upon by it; and in the
confusion Castries was able to make his escape. Riedesel
being weak in numbers could not stop him, though he
fell furiously with his hussars upon the rear-guard and
cut one regiment of French infantry to pieces; but
except for this loss Castries retired with little damage.
Thus, as so often happens, failed the most important
detail of Ferdinand's elaborate combinations.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French main army, startled out of its
sleep by the sound of the guns about Hombrechsen, was
in absolute confusion. Fortunately for the Marshals,
the unlucky mistake as to Lückner's corps which had
saved Castries, saved them also, since it checked
Spörcke's advance against their right. Breaking up
their camp with amazing rapidity, they formed upon
the heights and hastened their baggage away towards
Cassel. Lückner, awake to the miscarriage of the
turning movement on the French right, now begged
Kielmansegge, who commanded the left column of
Spörcke's corps, to hasten with him to Hohenkirchen,
from whence a cross way to westward would enable
them to bar every road between Wilhelmsthal and
Cassel. But Kielmansegge persisted in attacking the
right flank of the French main body, despite the fact
that it was covered by a brook running through a
swampy valley; and before he could effect his passage
over this obstacle, the opportunity for cutting off the
French retreat was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the troops under Ferdinand in the centre
advanced against the French front, though very slowly.
Spörcke's right column formed up on their left, but
being out of its right place hampered the advance of
the rest and caused lamentable delay. The French
main army, having cleared its baggage out of the way,
was falling back in several columns towards Wilhelmsthal,
when the appearance of Granby on their left
showed them the full extent of their peril. The flower
of the French infantry was then collected under M. de
Stainville and thrown out on the left to cover the
retreat of the main body at any cost; and now the
action began in earnest. Taking up a strong position
in a wood Stainville prepared to do his utmost.
Granby's infantry consisted of three battalions of
British Guards, the British grenadiers in three battalions,
and the Fifth and Eighth Foot,&mdash;some of the finest
troops in the British Army&mdash;but the fight was long and
stubborn. Stainville appears at first to have taken the
offensive and to have fallen upon the head of Granby's
columns before the whole of his troops had come up,
but to have been gradually forced back as more and
more of the British battalions advanced into action.
French and English came to close quarters, guns were
taken and retaken, and for a time two British cannon
remained in the hands of the French. Granby, however,
seems to have got the upper hand at last, to have
surrounded the wood on two sides and to have made
his dispositions for surrounding it on all sides, when
Ferdinand's troops at last came up on Stainville's rear
and put an end to the conflict. The gallant Frenchman's
corps was nearly annihilated; fifteen hundred
men were killed and wounded, nearly three thousand
surrendered to the Fifth Foot alone,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> and two battalions
only made good their escape. The Allied army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
advanced a little to the south of Wilhelmsthal; and so
the action came to an end.</p>

<p>The losses of the Allies were small, reaching but
seven hundred men killed and wounded, of which four
hundred and fifty belonged to Granby's corps. The
result of the action was in fact a great disappointment,
due partly to the mistakes of Spörcke and Kielmansegge,
partly to the extreme slowness of Ferdinand's advance
in the centre. The main body of the Allies indeed
seems to have taken five hours to move from
Gröbenstein to Wilhelmsthal, a distance of little more
than four miles; and the fact would appear to indicate
considerable clumsiness on the part of some officer or
officers in the handling of their men. Still the fact
remained that forty thousand men had attacked seventy
thousand and driven them back in confusion; and the
French were not a little shamefaced and discouraged
over their defeat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July 1.<br />July 24.<br />Aug. 30.</div>

<p>On the night of the action Soubise and d'Estrées
fell back across the Fulda and took up a position
between Cassel and Lutternberg. Ferdinand therefore
ordered Granby's corps to a position near Cassel
and sent forward a detachment to clear the enemy from
the north bank of the Eder; whereupon the French
evacuated Fritzlar and retiring across the Fulda took
post upon its eastern bank. Both armies remained in
this position until the 1st of July, Ferdinand trying
always to force the French back, but obliged to act
with caution, since Prince Xavier's Saxons had joined
the French at Lutternberg and might at any time
give trouble on the eastern side of the Weser. Finally
on the 24th he boldly attacked the French right at
Lutternberg and completely defeated it.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The French
thereupon fell back to Melsungen on the Fulda, while
Ferdinand took up a position opposite to them on the
western bank of the river and threatened their communications
with Frankfort. The Marshals then
summoned Condé from the Rhine, but Ferdinand continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
to press their communications so hard that at
length they evacuated Göttingen and retreated by
Hersfeld and Fulda to Vilbel, a little to the north of
Frankfort; Ferdinand marching parallel with them on
their western flank to the Nidda, in the hope, which
was disappointed, of preventing their junction with
Condé. So far he had done well, for he had for the
present driven the French armies from Hesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 7.<br />Sept. 15.</div>

<p>Meanwhile Condé, obedient to orders, had marched
towards Frankfort, joining Soubise a little to the south
of Friedberg on the 30th of August. The Hereditary
Prince, who had followed him closely all the way from
the Rhine, attacked him on the same day, apparently in
ignorance of the presence of Soubise's army, and was
repulsed with considerable loss. For the next few days
the two armies remained inactive, Ferdinand between
the Nidder and Nidda with his headquarters at Staden,
facing south-west, and the French opposite to him
between Friedburg and Butzbach. Such a position,
while forces were so unequal, could not continue long;
and on the 7th of September the French moved northward
by Giessen towards the Eder. Ferdinand, divining
that their design was to cut him off from Cassel, which
it was his own intention to besiege, at once hurried
northward to stop them. It was a race between the
two armies. The French travelled due north by
Giessen and Marburg, crossing the Lahn above the
latter town. Ferdinand made for Homberg on the
north bank of the Ohm, and turning north-westward
from thence marched on by Kirchhain and Wetter,
where he overtook the French advanced guard. On
the following day he offered battle; but Soubise
declined, and, turning to the right about, repassed the
Lahn and encamped along the line of the Ohm, with
his left at Marburg and his right over against Homberg.
Ferdinand thereupon took post in full sight of the
enemy on the opposite bank of the river, with his left
at Homberg and his right extended beyond Kirchhain.
This was the position from which he had intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
Imhoff to cover Hesse in 1760; and he had no intention
now of allowing the French to break through it
to Cassel, for he had made up his mind to recover
Cassel for himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">September.</div>

<p>The valley of the Ohm south-eastward from
Kirchhain is about eleven hundred yards broad, rising
gradually on the east bank of the river to a height
called the Galgenberg, and on the western bank to a
steep basaltic hill known as the Amöneberg. The Ohm
itself between these hills is from twenty to thirty feet
wide and from five to seven feet deep, flowing between
steep banks. Just to the south of the Amöneberg was
a stone bridge by which stood a water-mill, consisting
of a massive court with a group of houses. The steep
sides of the Amöneberg frown close to it on the northern
hand; but to westward the ground rises in a gentle
slope, through which a hollow road, covered by an old
redoubt, ran down to the mill. The town and castle
of the Amöneberg itself was surrounded with a wall
and towers strong enough, on the south and south-western
sides, to defy all but heavy artillery. The
bridge with the mill and the castle beyond it were for
some reason neglected by the Allies. There had been
some attempt to secure the bridge itself, and a redoubt
had been begun on Ferdinand's side of the river for its
defence; but the breastwork was not above three feet
high and as many feet thick, so that it could be commanded
by an enemy's fire, and the more easily since
the western or French bank of the river was the higher.
The court of the mill was occupied by but thirteen
men; the old redoubt appears not to have been occupied
at all; and the garrison of the castle of Amöneberg
consisted of a single battalion of irregulars only. Yet
the Amöneberg was an advanced post over against the
enemy's left wing and on the enemy's side of the river;
and the possession of the bridge was of vital importance
to the Allies, not only to ensure communication with
that advanced post, but to bar the advance of the
French across the Ohm and to secure to Ferdinand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
means of taking the offensive. The carelessness which
allowed these points to remain so slenderly guarded is
therefore almost inexplicable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 21.</div>

<p>The French were not slow to take advantage of the
opening thus afforded to them. On the night of the
20th they invested the castle of the Amöneberg so
closely that not a man of the garrison could pass
through their lines, and, driving the thirteen men from
the mill, occupied the court as well as the old redoubt
with light troops. This done they waited till morning,
and at six o'clock, under cover of a dense mist, opened
a heavy fire on the bridge and on the unfinished redoubt
beyond it. The men in that redoubt, two hundred
Hanoverians, resisted stoutly, in order to gain time for
their supports to come up and for their artillery on
the Galgenberg to answer the French batteries. The
corps in occupation of the ground immediately before
the Brückemühle (for so the mill was named) was
Zastrow's of seven battalions, seven squadrons and six
guns; while Wangenheim's corps of about the same
strength lay on his left, and Granby's<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> on the heights
of Kirchhain to his right. Ferdinand on hearing the
sound of the firing hastened to the scene of action
and found the redoubt still safe, the two hundred
Hanoverians having held it stubbornly for two hours
until relieved by Zastrow. But meanwhile the French
brought forward more guns behind the veil of the mist;
and presently thirty pieces of cannon were playing
furiously upon the redoubt, while the infantry under
cover of the fire renewed their attack on the bridge.
Zastrow continued to feed the redoubt with fresh
troops, and so held his ground; but the full significance
of the attack was not realised until at ten o'clock the
mist rolled away, when it was seen by the French dispositions
that the enemy was bent upon carrying the
bridge at any cost. Then at last Ferdinand ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
up Granby's corps from Kirchhain to Zastrow's
assistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sept. 22.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the fight waxed hotter. The superiority
of the French in artillery made itself felt; nine out of
twelve of Zastrow's guns were dismounted by noon, and
the rest were silent for want of ammunition. At length
at four o'clock the British Guards and the Highlanders
arrived; and twelve German field-pieces attached to
Granby's corps came also into action. The French
likewise brought up reinforcements and the combat
became livelier than ever. So far the reliefs for the
garrison in the redoubt had marched down in regular
order, but the fire of the French artillery was now so
terrible that the men were ordered to creep down singly
and dispersed, as best they could. British Guards
replaced Hanoverians, and Hessians replaced British
Guards; regiment after regiment taking its turn to
send men to certain destruction. So the fight wore on
till the dusk lowered down and the flashes of the guns
turned from yellow to orange and from orange to red.
The Hessians piled up the corpses of the dead into a
rampart and fired on, for the redoubt though untenable
must be held at any cost. At seven o'clock the French
by a desperate effort carried the passage of the bridge
and fought their way close up to the redoubt, but they
were met by the same dogged resistance and repulsed;
and at eight o'clock, after fourteen hours of severe
fighting, they abandoned the attack. Zastrow's and
Granby's corps bivouacked about the bridge, and
Ferdinand took up his quarters in the mill; but on
the next day, none the less, the French after several
unsuccessful assaults forced the garrison of Amöneberg
to an honourable capitulation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">November.</div>

<p>The loss of the Allies in this action was about seven
hundred and fifty killed and wounded, more than a
third of whom were British; the Scots Guards suffering
more heavily than any corps of the troops engaged.
The loss of the French rose to twelve hundred men,
and the failure of their attack decided the fate of Hesse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
Ferdinand, who on his advance southward had left
behind a force to blockade Cassel, was able within three
weeks to spare troops enough for a regular siege. On
the 16th of October the trenches were opened, and on
the 1st of November the town surrendered. A few
days later came the news that preliminaries of a treaty
had been signed. For despite all the successes of the
year nothing could deter Bute from his resolution to
make peace; and, indeed, knowledge of this fact had
latterly made English commanders negligent and British
troops backward in the field.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> So with the fall of Cassel
the war came to an end.</p>

<p>The terms, including as they did the cession by the
French of India, except Pondicherry and Chandernagore,
of French America, Canada, Tobago, Dominica
and St. Vincent, might not seem unfavourable to
England. But it was reasonably thought at the time
that Goree and Martinique should have been added,
though Bute was in such haste to bring the war to an
end that it was only as an afterthought that he exacted
the cession of Florida by Spain in exchange for Havanna.
But the true blot on the treaty was the desertion of
Frederick the Great and the conclusion of a separate
peace, an exhibition of selfishness and folly which recalled
the Peace of Utrecht. Nevertheless Frederick
was able to insist on the conditions from which he
had from the first resolved not to recede, namely the
retention of all that he had taken from Austria in
Silesia. In February 1763 the peace was finally concluded,
and Frederick entered Berlin with Ferdinand of
Brunswick, who had through five campaigns guarded
his right flank, appropriately seated at his right side.</p>

<p>The story of the war in Germany should not be
closed without some few words as to Ferdinand, who,
little though we know of him, was the greatest commander
that led British troops to victory in Europe
between Marlborough and Wellington. It was no small
feat to have fought through five campaigns successfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
always with one army against two, and with at most
four men against five. It is true that the conception of
his most skilful movements may often be traced to
Westphalen, the chief of his staff; but it is not every
commander who knows when to take advice and how to
act on it, or is so sure of the confidence of his troops
that he can trust them always to make the best of
it. Moreover, he was confronted, though in a smaller
degree, with many of the difficulties that afflicted Marlborough.
His army was not an army of Allies, though
generally so styled, but a mercenary army of German
troops in the pay of England. So far he had the
advantage of the great Duke; but his force was
compounded of several different elements, British, Hanoverians,
Hessians, Brunswickers and Bückeburgers,
who were divided by not a little jealousy as to their
respective precedence, privileges, and superiority. Of all
of these the British gave him the most trouble. Their
insular contempt for all foreigners was heightened by
the knowledge that their comrades were mercenaries
paid by their own nation; and they claimed the best
quarters, the post of danger and the post of honour on
all occasions. In one respect perhaps they did show
superiority to the rest of the army, namely when
actually on the field of battle; for beyond all doubt
theirs is the chief credit for the success at Minden, at
Warburg, at Emsdorff, at Wilhelmsthal, and in a lesser
degree at Vellinghausen. In every action indeed they did
well, and at Minden and Emsdorff they accomplished
what probably no other troops in the army would have
attempted. But there were scores of minor actions
fought during these campaigns by German troops only,
which could be matched against any other of their
achievements; and there were grave defects which
marred not a little the general efficiency of the British.
In the first place there was a large number of British
officers of all ranks from the general to the ensign who,
though brave enough, knew nothing of their duty. In
the second, as Turenne had noticed a century earlier in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
Flanders, they were extremely negligent in the matter
of outposts, patrols, and guards, owing partly to inexperience,
partly to their more luxurious life at home, and
partly to the contempt of danger and the spirit of
gambling which is so strong in the race. Frequently
Ferdinand, though quite alive to the valour of British
troops in action, dared not trust them as advanced
parties; whereupon the red-coats themselves, quite confident
of their own sufficiency, grumbled because the
foremost place was not given to them. Such jealousies
as these gave endless trouble; and the disposition of the
various corps, particularly of Granby's division of the
Guards and Blues, required careful study as a matter
not of military exigency but of policy and tact, lest the
various nationalities in the army should fall at variance
and take to fighting among themselves. Lastly, the
British soldiers, taken as a whole, were men of inferior
character to the Germans and of less experience in war;
and by loose behaviour in quarters and on the march
they set a bad example, which came ill from the men
that looked down on all the rest of the army.</p>

<p>Such were the troubles which hampered Ferdinand
and his staff at every turn; yet under his guidance the
machine worked always with the least possible friction
and the greatest development of power. He was in
fact not only a great soldier but a great governor and
leader of men. He combined patience, tact, and self-control
with a genial and hearty courtesy, he had the
faculty of selecting good men for his instruments, and
above all he worked without fear or favour in noble
singleness of purpose for the common cause. Of his
merits as a General his campaigns speak sufficiently; and
it is only necessary to add that their history was thought
worthy of official study and compilation fifty years ago
by the Prussian General Staff. British troops may feel
proud to have so served under so able a soldier and so
great and gallant a man in the campaigns which they
fought in Germany for the conquest of their own
empire.</p>

hostilities which opened with the declaration of war
with Spain and closed with the Peace of Fontainebleau;
for despite the brief truce made by the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle,
the armies of England and France were
eternally in collision either in the far east or the far
west, so that to all intent the struggle resolved itself into
one long war. Little though she knew it, England,
when she entered wantonly and with a light heart upon
the attack on the Spanish Main, had really set herself to
wrestle with the French for the empire of the world.
For nearly seventeen years she waited for the man who
would carry her victorious through the contest; and at
last he appeared. The instant change which came over
the spirit of the nation when he assumed command has
already been shown in the narrative of the operations.
It remains only to study more closely the conduct of the
war in the departments at home, and to trace the
progress, not only in the organisation and training of
the various branches of the Army, but also in the general
administration.</p>

<p>The war with Spain opened, as will be remembered,
while the nation had not yet ceased to rail at the iniquity
of a standing Army, when the ascendency of the civilian
element at the War Office was overpowering, and when
the attitude of the ordinary citizen towards the soldier
was unfriendly even to aggression. These evils, as may
be guessed, did not pass away at once, even though the
obnoxious red-coats were embarked or embarking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
foreign service. In 1741 there was a general refusal of
innkeepers to supply soldiers with food and forage, owing
to the dearth caused by a winter of extraordinary
severity. Such refusal was not unreasonable; and it
was proposed to meet the difficulty by a new clause in
the Mutiny Act. It will hardly be believed that one
member of the House of Commons made this suggestion
a pretext for urging that the Mutiny Act should be dispensed
with altogether, his argument being that if the
system of billets should break down it would be necessary
to build barracks, which would result in the subjection
of the country to military government.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Two years
later again<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> advantage was taken of an address to the
King respecting his hired Hessian troops, to insert words,
designed evidently for purposes of insult only, referring
to, the burthensome and useless army at home. Nor did
such amenities end even after the warning of 1745, for
the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, which left the air still
electric with war, was no sooner signed than the old
foolish arguments against a standing Army reappeared
in the House of Lords, propped by such stable epigrams
as "To a free state an army is like drams to a constitution."
Yet the full measure of the intoxicant which
was distilled for the ruin of the nation was a niggardly
draught of nineteen thousand men. These childish
outbursts continued until 1754, when they ceased, at any
rate until the close of the war, having served their mischievous
purpose in keeping alive old animosities which
common patriotism and common sense would have
buried without ceremony. The ill-will of publicans and
of municipalities continued likewise unabated for a few
years,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> but rapidly dwindled away before more generous
feelings; and unreasonable complaints from this quarter
almost disappear from the correspondence of the War
Office after Dettingen.</p>

<p>The War Office itself was slower to mend its ways.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>The Secretary-at-War was quite equal to such petty
jobbery as procuring the promotion of sergeants and
corporals; but for all other purposes the Office showed
itself at first to be utterly and hopelessly inefficient.
Glimpses of maladministration have already been seen in
the account of the expedition to Carthagena; but the
blindness and ignorance of the officials became still more
patent when Lord Stair's force was despatched to the
Netherlands. The Office had not been at the pains to
keep even its records in order. Not a soul seems to
have known what were the rules as to allowances for
forage, baggage, and the like, for troops embarking on
active service; and the officials were obliged to apply
to old officers who had served with Marlborough to
gather precedents on such purely departmental matters
as these.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> From such beginnings it is not difficult to
judge of that which must have come after.</p>

<p>The Office of Ordnance also was at the outset as
badly disorganised as the War Office. Its shortcomings
have already been shown in the matter of the train sent
out to Carthagena; but even a year after the departure
of Cathcart it seems to have made no improvement.
Transports destined for the West Indies in 1741 were
obliged to put in at Cork because the water shipped at
Spithead was undrinkable, and the provisions supplied
for the men unfit to eat.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> Stair, again, was despatched
to the Netherlands without artillery or engineers, a
deficiency which brought his force into immense contempt
with the French; and when he asked for siege-guns
he found that all England could afford him was but
twenty twenty-four pounders.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> Small arms again were so
scarce that, when the king rearmed the infantry, it was
necessary to purchase ten thousand muskets and bayonets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>abroad.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> In Scotland again the inquiries of Hawley and
Handasyde revealed not less flagrant neglect.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> But this
was by no means all. The general condition of the
national defences both at home and abroad was most
alarming; and the result was that at the opening of 1743
there was a regular panic among all the seaports, great
and small, on the coast of England. Frantic applications
poured into the Office of Ordnance for guns,
carriages, and ammunition. It seems to have been the
custom for the minor ports to erect batteries at their
own expense, and to apply to the Government for their
armament; so that the blame for these shortcomings
must rest in part upon local authorities. But there is no
such excuse for carelessness in respect of regular strongholds,
such as Pendennis Castle, where forty-six guns
were found to be in charge of a master-gunner ninety
years of age, aided by a single assistant. It was not until
1756, when ministers should have been looking after
Minorca, that the Government suddenly took the alarm
and threw up lines of defence at Chatham, Portsea, and
Plymouth Dock.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Colonial stations, for which the British Government
was responsible, were in little better order. Newfoundland
was in a deplorable condition,<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> and Gibraltar even
worse; nor could all the representations of officers
procure attention for them. As late as in May 1757,
even after the actual fall of Minorca, Governor Lord
Tyrawley wrote furiously of the state of affairs at the
Rock. There had been total stagnation for many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>years; letters had not been answered; requests often
repeated had remained unheeded. The guns mounted
on the fortress were too short, the spare carriages were
too few, the palisades better fitted for hen-coops than
for fortifications; in fact the defences were reduced to
dangerous weakness by years of systematic neglect.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
At St. Kitts, again, the Thirty-eighth Foot, which for
years had formed the standing garrison, was in a
miserable condition; not forty per cent of the men
were fit for service; their clothing was in rags; they
had neither hats nor shoes nor cartridge-boxes nor
swords.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Nor were the self-governing colonies more
careful than the mother country. Wealthy West Indian
Islands, notwithstanding the incessant warnings of their
governors, found themselves at the outbreak of the
war in dangerous want of arms and ammunition; and
there was a rush of all the colonies both in the West
Indies and in America for guns and stores, which
ought to have been ready in their own magazines.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
British carelessness, aggravated by the evil example
of factious politicians in the mother country, and by
the spectacle of such a creature as Newcastle in high
place, had well-nigh stripped the empire of its
defences.</p>

<p>As to the Army itself, enough has been said in the
account of the operations to show how unstable, despite
the abundance of individual heroism, were the foundations
upon which it rested. The interference of civilian
administrators and of irresponsible politicians with
military discipline had wrought mischief untold.
Officers could not be brought to do duty with their
regiments. Stair found the difficulty insuperable; so
also did Hawley; so even did Cumberland in Scotland;
while in the garrison of Minorca the evil transcended
all bounds. Thus both the <em>personnel</em> and <em>matériel</em> of
the Army were nearly ruined, the former by persistent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>jobbery and meddling on the part of civil officials, the
latter by the equally persistent carping of factious
critics in the House of Commons, which forbade the
presentation of estimates for necessary works. The
military system was in fact a chaos; and it was only by
the strenuous efforts of two men, who strangely enough
abominated each other, that this chaos was reduced
to order.</p>

<p>The first of these two was Cumberland. Though
in many respects a martinet of a narrow type, and
no great commander in the field, Cumberland was an
able man, a strong man, and an administrator. He
it was who first took the Army seriously in hand and
set himself to reduce it to discipline. He began
during his first campaign by teaching the officers that
they must obey. Hitherto it seems that they had
taken the field as if they were going to a picnic,
after the fashion of the French, travelling comfortably
if not luxuriously, and neglecting all duties except that
of displaying gallantry in action. Cumberland quickly
put a stop to this. The number of wheeled carriages,
even for general officers, was strictly limited, and two
only, one for the colonel and one for the sutler, were
allowed in each regiment; while in order to reduce
baggage still further, it was ordered that no officer
under the rank of brigadier-general should appear
either in camp or in quarters, on or off duty, except in
his regimental coat, old or new.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Such orders may
appear ludicrous at the present day, but they point to
a tightening of the reins of discipline that was very
sorely needed. Cumberland, too, was impatient of
useless officers. He disliked the system of purchase<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>
and chafed at the retention of old colonels, some so
unfit for duty as to be confined in a mad-house, whose
permanent presence on the active list prevented the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>advancement of deserving officers.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> His own selections
were not always fortunate, as witness Hawley and
Braddock, but he was fully alive to the merit of such
men as Ligonier, Wolfe, and Conway, to whom, though
not of his school, he gladly gave promotion.</p>

<p>But it is after the close of the first war, when the
Duke had returned to be Commander-in-Chief in time
of peace, that his work is seen to greatest advantage.
The whole tone of the War Office is changed. The
Secretary-at-War almost reverts to his old position of
clerk to the Commander-in-Chief. Military authority
is predominant in military matters, and "Secretary-at-War's
leave of absence" becomes a thing of the past.
The functionary, who not many years before was ready
to perpetrate a job for any officer with vote or interest,
suddenly develops virtuous scruples and objects to
the once familiar phrase, as he never grants leave without
the King's signature.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> But it is less by isolated
examples, such as this, than by a general alteration in the
methods of transacting business, that the Duke's hand
may be traced. There is no longer the indiscriminate
correspondence with every rank of officer; but due
regard is paid to the rights of superior officers as
channels of communication and discipline, and to the
authority of the Commander-in-Chief as the supreme
motive power. In fact, a work of great and beneficial
reform is seen to accomplish itself imperceptibly through
the will and influence of a single strong man; and
Cumberland's services herein have never received the
recognition that they deserve. The Duke, indeed,
with all his foibles and prejudices was no ordinary man;
and it is no surprise to one who has followed his administrative
work to find that Horace Walpole ranked
him with his father, Sir Robert Walpole, with Granville,
Mansfield, and Pitt as one of the five great men that he
had known. It is no disparagement of other members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>of the Royal Family to say that he was the ablest man
which it has produced during the two centuries of its
reign in England.</p>

<p>The other man who raised the tone of the Army
beyond estimation was of course Pitt. His share in the
work, however, was very different in its nature from
Cumberland's; though, without the preliminary reforms
of Cumberland, his influence could hardly have been so
successful as it was. Pitt's instincts respecting military
administration, as distinct from the statesman's choice of
a theatre of war, were thoroughly sound. He was for
allowing officers to do their work, and for backing them
loyally as they did it. Thus when in 1750 George
Townsend, afterwards Wolfe's brigadier, proposed a
clause in the Mutiny Bill to prevent non-commissioned
officers or privates from being punished except by
sentence of court-martial, Pitt crushed him with words
which deserve to be remembered. "We," he said,
"have no business with the conduct of the Army, nor
with their complaints one against another. If we give
ear to any such complaint we shall either destroy all
discipline, or the House will be despised of officers and
detested of soldiers." Cumberland himself would have
asked for no severer criticism than this; and yet Pitt,
though perhaps unconsciously, was probably more obnoxious
in his military even than in his political views
to Cumberland. The Duke, as has been repeatedly
illustrated, was a soldier of the rigidest German type.
"He was as angry," to use Walpole's happy phrase,
"at an officer's infringing the minutest precept of the
military rubric as at his deserting his post, and was as
intent on establishing the form of spatterdashes and
cockades as on taking a town or securing an advantageous
situation." In other words, he lacked that sense
of proportion in matters of discipline which distinguishes
the disciplinarian from the martinet. Now, despite the
influence of Cumberland, there was growing up in the
Army a school of officers quite as strict as he was in
needful matters of discipline, but less rigid, less narrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
and more humane&mdash;officers who looked upon their men
not as marionettes to be dressed and undressed, used up
and thrown away, but as human flesh and blood, with
good feelings that could be played on, good understandings
that could be instructed, self-respect that
needed only to be cultivated, and high instincts that
waited only to be evoked. Such an officer, as his
regimental orders can prove, was Wolfe, who contrived
to turn even the work of road-making in Scotland to
excellent disciplinary account; and indeed I am disposed
to think that this same road-making, first begun
under the direction of the mild and gentle Wade, had
much to do with the foundation of the new school.
The officers were brought very much more into contact
with their men off parade, being obliged to supervise
them while at work and to enjoin on them conciliatory
bearing and behaviour towards the inhabitants; and the
men, on their side, were happy and well-conducted, for
they were kept constantly employed and received a welcome
addition to their pay. It must be remembered
that the gulf fixed between officer and man at that time
was much wider than at present. Nowadays it is
nothing for the subalterns of the smartest regiment of
cavalry to pull off their coats and work with their men
at the unshipping of horses from a transport; then it
was almost painful to men to see their officers lay their
hand to any but officer's work. A sergeant of Murray's
garrison at Quebec describes the labours of his officers
when hauling up the guns almost with tears. Such
things were not seemly for gentlemen to do. But
beyond all doubt the new school introduced a healthier
feeling between officers and men, having the courage to
utter its sentiments in print. "Never beat your men,"
says an officer's manual of the year 1760; "it is
unmanly. I have too often seen a brave, honest old
soldier banged and battered at the caprice of an arrogant
officer." And then follows a protest against picketting,
tying neck and heels, the wooden horse and other
punishments of torture, which were never inflicted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
court-martial, but by the authority of officers only.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>
Such teaching was not in accordance with the system
of Cumberland as expounded by himself or by his
favourites Braddock and Hawley.</p>

<p>Yet it was to officers of this new school that Pitt,
when he could have his way, preferred to entrust his
work, partly perhaps on account of their youth and
vigour, but more probably owing to their freedom from
the fetters of pipeclay. Amherst, though he maintained
an excellent tone among his troops, was hardly a
perfect representative of the school, but Howe and
Wolfe were pre-eminently of it, as were likewise such of
Wolfe's pupils as Monckton and Murray. India seems
spontaneously to have produced men who commanded
in virtue of personal ascendency, though the only training
of Lawrence, Forde, and Coote had been that of
regimental officers. Still these men, though appointed
by sheer force of circumstances and by no nomination of
Pitt's, served to confirm the correctness of his judgment.</p>

<p>By giving scope to this new stamp of officer Pitt
rendered the Army signal service, apart from the spirit
which he infused into it, as into every body of Englishmen,
of energy and adventure. He was too good a
master for men to be willing to return to him, unless
they had fulfilled their mission or exhausted every effort
to fulfil it. It is possible even that the raids on the
French coast, which are a blot on his fame as a minister
of war, might have been more successful (though they
could never have been profitable) could he have appointed
commanders of his own choice. But in truth
the work of Pitt as a designer of campaigns and operations
of war was by no means flawless. He had skill
in thinking out how a body of men could be passed
rapidly on from enterprise to enterprise, as from Guadeloupe
to Canada, from Canada back to Martinique,
from Martinique to Havanna, and from Havanna, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
he hoped, to Louisiana. But he never made sufficient
allowance for the waste of men in the process, nor, apparently,
for the loss of life entailed by maintaining
large garrisons in tropical territory. In some respects,
too, the military administration was little better in his
day than in Newcastle's. Notwithstanding the warning
given by the terrible losses of the troops during the
occupation of Louisburg, no proper care was taken to
provide them with special clothing in subsequent winters
in Canada; while the arrangements for the hospitals in
Germany were so deficient that few of the invalids of
the campaign of 1760 ever rejoined their regiments.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
Hodgson, again, before starting for Belleisle, complained
bitterly of his want of officers and of the inadequacy of
the preparations made by the Office of Ordnance. These
abuses were, it is true, due to the shortcomings of
departments only, and therefore must not be charged
against a minister who bore the burden, not only of the
direction of the war, but of foreign affairs also on his
shoulders; but it is, I think, a reproach to Pitt's
military administration that he did not appreciate the
importance of husbanding the lives of his troops. The
British soldier, to put the matter in its least sentimental
and most brutally practical light, has always been a most
expensive article; no prodigality can be more ruinous
than the careless squandering of his life, no economy so
false as the grudging of his comfort. But this failing
in Pitt, serious though it be, is far outweighed by the
profound policy which converted the militia into an
efficient force for defence against invasion, thus liberating
the regular army for purposes of conquest; and by the
military insight which kept King Frederick subsidised,
and Prince Ferdinand's army afoot as auxiliary to
Frederick, thus turning the whole war in Europe into a
diversion in England's favour. Nor was this policy
wholly selfish, for loudly though the Prussians still
complain of the withdrawal of Pitt's subsidies by Bute,
Pitt remained in office long enough to tide Frederick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
over the deadliest of his peril, and so to establish the
corner-stone of the present German Empire. Yet even
these achievements pale before the mighty genius and
the lofty enthusiasm which called the English-speaking
people to arms on both sides the Atlantic to wrest from
France the possession of the world. The minister of
war is swallowed up in the statesman of the Empire.</p>

<p>The next subject of inquiry is the manner of raising
that Army, large beyond precedent in English history,
which was accumulated by the end of the war. It will
be remembered that the regiments of cavalry rose to
thirty-two, and that in the infantry of the Line the
numbered regiments were one hundred and twenty-four,
besides two corps of Highlanders (which for some reason
were known by titles of a different kind) and the brigade
of Guards, making altogether a total little short of one
hundred and fifty battalions. To provide recruits for
such a force on the ordinary terms was impossible; and
the struggle with France had hardly begun before recourse
was made to the system of short service. In the
session of 1743-44 was passed the first of a series of
Recruiting Acts on the model of those which had been
passed under Queen Anne. The bounty offered to
volunteers was four pounds, while parish-officers were
empowered to impress unemployed men, for each of
which they received a reward of one pound and the
parish of three pounds. The standard for recruits was
fixed at five feet five inches; and it was enacted that
every volunteer or enlisted man should be entitled to
his discharge at the end of three years. In the following
session the Act was somewhat altered. The bounty to
volunteers was abolished; the gift to the parish was
reduced to two pounds; the standard was lowered by
one inch, and the term of service was extended to five
years. But as yet of course the real drain on the supply
of Englishmen was not begun.</p>

<p>After the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle an effort was
made in the House of Commons to establish the principle
of short service in time of peace. In February 1750<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
Mr. Thomas Pitt, a kinsman of the Great Commoner,
brought forward a bill to enact that soldiers should
henceforward be enlisted for ten years, and that the price
of discharge should be fixed at three pounds. The
scheme was opposed on the ground that men would
always claim discharge after receiving their new clothing,
and so defraud the colonel; that the country would be
filled with idle vagabonds; and that the Pretender's
adherents would take advantage of the measure to obtain
military training, which would later be turned against
England herself. One speaker, who supported the bill,
thought ten years too long a term; and Colonel Henry
Conway, an officer of much promise, while approving
the principle contended that the bill as it stood would
be useless, since no man would enlist for service in
Ireland or the Colonies without a bounty, nor accept
smaller bounty than the cost of his discharge. More
than one member who took part in the debate deplored
the system of enlisting men for life, which by depriving
them of hope made them idle and disorderly; but all
agreed that the limitation of the term of service must
inevitably lead to increased expense, since it would entail
the need of a larger number of recruits. The expense
of recruiting fell at that time of course on the officers,
pay being allowed for a few fictitious men on the muster-rolls,
and the proceeds turned into a recruiting fund.
While this practice lasted, it was futile to speak of
enlisting more recruits, for the officers simply could not
afford it. It was useless to urge, as Conway and Oglethorpe
did, that the expense of recruiting at ordinary
times should be borne not by the regiment but by the
public; for this would have meant an augmentation
in the military estimates which was not to be thought
of for a moment. So after a useful debate the bill was
defeated by one hundred and fifty-four to ninety-two.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>On the renewal of the war a Recruiting Act identical
with that of 1744-45 was passed; but in the following
year (1756-57) a bounty of three pounds was again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
offered to volunteers, who were also allowed to take
service for three years only. With this latter Act the
measures sanctioned by Parliament came to an end, and
though this particular enactment was passed, as usual,
for one year only, I conceive that it must have been
renewed annually to the close of the war.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> There were
of course the usual abuses in the enforcement of these
Acts, abuses which rose to a grave height towards the
end of the war. The country was so much exhausted
in 1762 that the standard was reduced to five feet two
inches,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> by which time men made a regular living by
hanging about the recruiting officers, ready to accompany
them before a justice and to swear that some hapless
creature had taken the King's bounty.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> Practically
there was impressment for the army as for the navy;
and indeed as early as in 1744 the newspapers speak
openly of a general press made in Southwark for the
Army and marines, with the satisfactory result of a haul
of two hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> Nor was impressment without
its usual romantic consequences. On one of the ships
of Admiral Boscawen's squadron in 1748 was a marine
named James Gray, who was duly landed with the rest
for the siege of Pondicherry. In the course of the
siege Gray had the misfortune to be wounded, apparently
by splinters, receiving six wounds in one leg, five in the
other and a bullet in the groin. This last hurt the
injured marine did not submit to the doctors, contriving
to extract the bullet without assistance, and so to make
a good recovery. In due time Gray returned to
England; and then there came a petition to the Duke
of Cumberland setting forth that James Gray was in a
reality a woman named Hannah Snell. Her sweetheart
had been impressed, so she had enlisted and followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>him to India, braving all the misery of the voyage and
the hardships of the siege to be with him; but all had
been to no purpose, for the sweetheart had died, leaving
her alone, maimed, friendless and penniless. It is satisfactory
to learn that Cumberland at once obtained for
her a pension of thirty pounds a year from the King's
own bounty.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>It should be remembered, meanwhile, that since the
Highlands had been thrown open, the old recruiting
grounds had been considerably enlarged, and that the
prospect of bearing arms had attracted great numbers of
Highlanders to the ranks. Exclusive of the Forty-second
there were at least a dozen Highland battalions
on the list in 1762. Irish Catholics again were admitted
to the Army, at any rate in America, and distinguished
themselves particularly in the Twenty-eighth Regiment
at Quebec, where Wolfe himself charged at their head.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
But to what other shifts the Government may have
resorted I have unfortunately been unable to discover.
It is more than probable that several corps were formed
under peculiar conditions of service. At least one
whole regiment of Highlanders, the Duke of Sutherland's,
was raised explicitly for three years only or till
the close of the war;<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> and the same principle was
doubtless extended to other cases. Private enterprise
also came to the help of the country. Very early in
the war a society was formed in London to promote
the enlistment of marines; and after Minden the
Common Council of London opened subscriptions to
encourage recruiting, and promised to admit men so
enlisted to trade within the city forthwith, if discharged
with a good character on the close of the war.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Then
again there were regiments like Hale's and Granby's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>Light Dragoons which were raised by patriotic officers
without cost to the country; and it is probable that
these were not solitary examples. Similar advantages
of economy seem to have dictated the creation in 1760
and the following years of innumerable independent
companies, which after a few months of isolated existence
were sorted together into regiments. The history
of this system is exceedingly obscure, but it appears to
have amounted practically to the offer of a commission
to every man who could or would raise a hundred
recruits. It was adopted amid considerable difference
of opinion, and was not a success, the men so enlisted
being generally unfit to carry a musket.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Speaking
broadly, it may be asserted that during this war the
ranks were filled by compulsion far more than by
attraction, and by compulsion so ruthless that recruits
would resort to self-mutilation to escape service.</p>

<p>An interesting experiment in the inner organisation
of the recruiting service was instituted by advice of
Lord Stair, namely the formation of two extra companies
of infantry and one extra troop of cavalry for
all regiments on active service. The object was to
maintain a depot at home to refill all vacancies in the
ranks abroad, and so to obviate the necessity of sending
back recruiting officers from abroad to England. The
plan did not at first commend itself to the King, and
Stair was obliged to urge it repeatedly before he could
obtain for it a trial; but the suggestion seems to
have been approved by Cumberland, and to have been
put into practice for a time, though the additional
companies were presently amalgamated into distinct
regiments.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Therewith the whole system of the feeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>of regiments abroad fell back on the old plan of
drafting; and during the Seven Years' War regiments
at home, particularly the dragoons,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> were raised to a
considerable strength to serve simply as recruiting
depots for regiments abroad. From a regimental
standpoint the story of the war is one of drafting,
drafting, drafting, with of course all the vices that had
been condemned by Marlborough attendant on the
practice. The garrisons of captured places suffered
terribly from this evil, particularly in the West Indies,
where service was still abominated by the men. There
was no such reluctance to go to the East Indies, where
there was some prospect of spoil; and men and officers
gladly took advantage of the opportunity afforded to
them not only to go to India, but to stay there in
the Company's service after their regiments had been
recalled.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> But the West Indies were held in horror
and loathing. It became more and more the practice
to pardon deserters and bad characters on their
accepting service in that unpopular quarter, though
even so there were men who preferred to take a
thousand lashes.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> As the operations in the West
Indies grew wider of extent, resort was made as usual
to drafting; whereupon the colonels, to whom it fell to
supply the drafts, of course seized the opportunity to
rid themselves of their worst men, heedless of the
unhappy corps to which they consigned them.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>government of a captured island in the Antilles on such
terms was no very enviable post.</p>

<p>But the British Isles were by no means the only
recruiting ground of the Army during this long
struggle. Braddock as early as in 1755 was ordered
to fill up his regiments with recruits from America;
and the system, as has already been seen, was carried
farther and farther as the war progressed. There
were at first considerable difficulties, which the British
Government attempted to meet by proclaiming that two
hundred acres of land should be granted free of rent
for ten years to all recruits, after the close of the war.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
It should seem, however, that this temptation was of
small effect, for the Americans enjoyed all the British
prejudice against a red-coat, and at first drew little distinction
between a soldier and a negro. The Sixtieth
in particular found great obstruction to recruiting in
Pennsylvania; the lawyers, justices, and people at large
being violently opposed to enlistment<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> even for short
terms of three or four years. Violent controversies
raged over the recruiting of indented servants, the
"white servants" or white slaves to which I have already
referred; their owners pleading not without reason that,
having paid for the passage of these men, they were
entitled to consider them as their own property, or,
to use their own phrase, as "bought servants." This
difficulty was settled by providing for compensation to
the owners for loss of such men; but even so the
most serious obstacles remained unremoved. In New
Jersey, for instance, the justices would persuade recruits
not to be attested, or would grant warrants against them
for fictitious debts and throw them into gaol until the
regiment that sought them had marched away. Finally
in 1760 Amherst wrote that, though his battalions
were seven thousand men below the proper strength,
he could obtain no recruits owing to the vast bounty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>offered by the provincial authorities to their own troops.
These facts should not be forgotten in view of the far
greater contest between mother country and colonies
which lies close ahead of us. The colonists boasted constantly,
and not without just cause, of the sacrifices
which they had made throughout the war; but they
overlooked the incessant difficulties which they threw
in the way of the King's commanders.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>Intimately connected with the subject of recruiting
is the general condition of the private soldier. There
was little or no alteration in his pay or allowances during
the period under review; and such changes as there
were tended if anything rather to his disadvantage. It
appears that the War Office had not yet learned that the
rigid rules applicable to service at home were impossible
of enforcement abroad, and either through blindness or
ignorance insisted that all additional burdens, imposed
by differences of climate and remoteness from civilisation,
must be borne by the soldier. The mutiny
roused at Louisburg by excessive stoppages from the pay
of the men has already been related; but so dangerous
a warning even as this produced no result, for the
grievance remained unredressed and led to a second
mutiny of the troops in Canada in 1763.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> The meanness
of the Government in respect of such matters was
indescribable. It would not even supply extra blankets
for the garrison of Quebec, but decided that the price
must be deducted from each soldier's pay, and this
although recruits were already hardly obtainable for
garrisons abroad.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Not an official, notwithstanding the
repeated representations of military officers, seems to
have been capable of devising a new system to cover
new conditions. The old formulæ were stretched and
stretched again till they became a mere confusion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>rents and patches, barely sufficient to cover the nakedness
of maladministration.</p>

<p>It is true that the Government was not wholly to
blame; it was rather that spirit of carping and meddlesome
criticism in the Commons which in these days has
led to what is called legislation by reference, with the
result that few Acts of Parliament are intelligible without
a complete body of the Statutes of the past century
to elucidate them. In mortal dread of distasteful
discussion of the military estimates, the civil authorities
clothed every possible grant of money in the garment of
pay for so many men, and made it over to regimental
officers to do their best or worst with it. Hence arose
a chaos of strange terms which are the bewilderment
and despair of every student. The mysteries of the
"recruiting-fund" have already been laid bare, and the
veil which shrouds the "widow's man" has likewise
been lifted; but the list is unfortunately far longer
than this. As though widow's men were not sufficient,
there were also "contingent men," fictitious men kept
on the rolls of every company that their pay might
discharge the contingent expenses of the captain.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Then
there was an item known as "grass-money," an allowance
of similar nature, but of so complicated a description
that it can be shown only in tabulated form.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>There were also curious devices whereby the foot-soldier
likewise was provided with certain necessary portions
of his equipment. Then there was yet another source
of regimental income called the stock-purse, which
applied originally to dragoons only, and was made up
partly from the recruiting fund, partly from the vacant
pay of men when the troop was below its established
strength, and partly from the value of cast horses.
The fund so collected was placed in the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
agent, to defray contingent expenses and current cost
of recruiting. As all horses were cast at the age of
fourteen, and as four horses, at a price not exceeding
twenty guineas apiece, were replaced every year irrespective
of those lost by death or accident, it may be
imagined that a stroke of bad luck might reduce a troop
to ruin. All this, however, was part of the system
which made the Army pay for itself, and was therefore
preserved in defiance of the trouble and confusion to
which it inevitably led. It may now be understood
why officers who loved their regiments frequently
bequeathed large sums of money to the regimental funds,
to enable their successors to secure good recruits and to
uphold the fair name of the corps.</p>

<p>Thus it is sufficiently evident that the Army,
notwithstanding the wild ravings in Parliament, did far
more for itself than the country did for it; though there
are signs that as an institution it was gradually finding
acceptance with the nation. In 1740 the nickname
of "lobster" for a soldier, which thirty or forty years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
ago was common enough, first made its appearance,
curiously enough with the Christian name of Thomas
prefixed to it.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Then in the same year Parliament
called for and printed a return of the officers of the
Army, which was continued yearly and ripened into
the annual Army List.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Another change also helped
to give regiments a surer identity in the popular
mind, namely the substitution of a number for the
colonel's name for the distinction of corps from corps.
This reform crept in during July 1753;<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> but it was
many years before the colonel's name was altogether
discarded, while the numbers did not find a place on the
buttons until 1767. Then, to pass to minuter matters,
sufficient deference was paid to the popular love of
military music to relieve the colonels in part of the
burden of hiring bandsmen, who, in some regiments
at any rate, were after 1749 enlisted as soldiers and
placed under military discipline.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> In the cavalry, where
the trumpeters supplied six or eight men more or less
skilled in the playing of a wind-instrument, the issue
of horns and bassoons to these sufficed more cheaply
to form a band of music;<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> but the main burden of
supporting a band has always lain, as it still lies, upon
the officers. Private enterprise, which thus forced
military musicians upon the country, strove also to
impose another modern fashion, but without success.
After his march to Fort Duquêsne General Forbes
caused a medal to be struck, of extremely florid design,
and authorised such of his officers as might desire it to
wear the same in gold suspended from their necks by a
blue ribbon.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The hint, however, was not taken at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>home,&mdash;possibly the fame of it never reached official
ears,&mdash;and though a medal might have increased the
flow of recruits and reconciled men to service beyond
sea, not one was issued. Ferdinand of Brunswick
received the Garter, and Amherst the red ribbon of
the Bath, but nothing was done to commemorate for
lesser men the share that they had taken in the conquest
of an empire.</p>

<p>I turn now to consideration of the military progress
in the three combatant branches of the Army. In the
Cavalry an early change, which has been perpetuated
by certain regimental titles to the present day, was the
conversion of the three senior regiments of Horse into
Dragoons, with the names which they still retain of the
First, Second, and Third Dragoon Guards. This was
done in December 1746 and was apparently part of a
general scheme of economy; for at precisely the same
time the Third and Fourth troops of the Life Guards
were disbanded, and two troops only reserved, together
with two troops of Horse Grenadier Guards.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> But
there seems also to have been somewhat of a craze for
dragoons at the moment,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> first because their pay was
small, and secondly, because Frederick the Great, in
imitation of the Austrians, had made greater mobility
the rule for all cavalry. In truth the old distinctions
between Horse and Dragoons were disappearing fast
and becoming very much a question of names. The
French indeed still made it a rule not to place dragoons
in the line of battle; but the horse in their army was
distinguished by being heavily clad in defensive armour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>Ligonier, who loved the cavalry above all arms, boldly
advised the disregard of all fanciful differences, and
the issue of defensive armour to the British dragoons;
but his recommendation remained unnoticed for twelve
years, when, in a true spirit of pedantry, cuirasses and
iron skull-caps were given in 1758 to the Blues and
in 1760 to the Third and Fourth Horse, or to give
them their present names, the Sixth and Seventh
Dragoon Guards.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Another defect noted by Ligonier
in the organisation of the cavalry was the extreme
weakness of the British squadrons as compared with
the French; for remedy of which he purposed to raise
the strength of troops of horse to fifty and of dragoons
to seventy-five troopers. Such a reform would have
been valuable as a return to Cromwell's system of
making the units strong enough to provide full
employment for the officers; but the authorities settled
the question in a far more simple fashion by ordaining
that three troops, instead of two as heretofore, should
be the strength of a squadron on service.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The country
has waited long for Ligonier's suggestion to be adopted,
and it is only within very recent years, if now, that it
has at last grasped the soundness of the principle.</p>

<p>More important as a step forward was the institution
of Light Dragoons, begun, as has been told, by
the establishment first of light troops and later of
complete light regiments. The example in this case
came from a corps formed during the Scottish rebellion
of 1745, the Duke of Kingston's Light Dragoons,
which did so good service that, though disbanded
after Culloden, it was at once reformed as the Duke
of Cumberland's own. As such it distinguished itself
greatly at Lauffeld, and Cumberland pleaded hard
that it might be spared after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>but with the usual blindness it was disbanded,
and thus a regiment of quite unusual value
and promise was sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Happily the Fifteenth
Light Dragoons made a most brilliant beginning for
the new branch of the cavalry, and assured its success.
The light dragoons were distinguished by wearing a
helmet of lacquered copper or leather, and were armed
with carbine, bayonet, pistol, and sword, carrying also
entrenching tools in their holsters. Their horses are
described as of the nag or hunter kind, standing from
fourteen hands three inches to fifteen hands one inch;
and their saddlery was lighter than that of the ordinary
dragoon. Being intended for employment as irregular
troops they were known from the first in England as
hussars;<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> but though they received special training in
horsemanship and in firing, even at a gallop, from the
saddle, they had little or no instruction in the duties of
reconnaissance, which were the peculiar function of the
hussar. Nothing could be more characteristic of the
difference between the true and the false light cavalry
than the behaviour of the Fifteenth at Emsdorff, who
charged through and through the French infantry
without hesitation, while the Prussian hussars, never
coming to close quarters, lost not a man nor a horse.
Fortunately it was not the true hussar that was most
sorely needed on that day.</p>

<p>For the rest, before the opening of the war the old
system of manœuvre by turning every horse in his own
ground had given place to that by wheeling of small
divisions, although the ranks were still formed three
deep. It does not appear that the drill introduced by
Frederick the Great for field-movements was adopted
either in whole or in part, though possibly it may have
been practised by individual colonels. Shock-action
our cavalry did not need to learn from Frederick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>having learned it already of Marlborough; but our
squadrons seem as usual to have been prone to
their besetting sin of unwillingness to rally after a
successful charge. It was this wild galloping forward
that wrecked Ligonier's heroic regiments at Lauffeld.
On the other hand, Granby's squadrons, for all their
leader's impetuosity, seem to have been well in hand
at Warburg, and to have done their work with spirit
and yet subject to control. But a trot of two hours
before coming into action had probably rubbed the
keen edge off both horses and men.</p>

<p>Passing next to the Artillery we approach the most
remarkable development observable during this period
in the whole Army. Notwithstanding the early disgraces
at Carthagena and the shortcomings of the
Office of Ordnance, the gunners after 1741 are found
to raise the reputation of their corps steadily in all parts
of the world. Their place as yet was still on the left
of the line, yielding precedence to the whole of the rest of
the Army, but they were entitling themselves to a higher
station. This sudden change is doubtless in great
measure attributable to the foundation of the Academy
at Woolwich, with an allowance at first of two hundred
pounds, which after a few months was increased to a
thousand pounds, a year.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> In 1744 the forty gentlemen
cadets were formed into a single company, and their
pay was raised from one shilling to sixteenpence a day;
their number also was increased to forty-eight, and
from thenceforth the cadet-company stood as the senior
company of the corps.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The growth of the Royal
Regiment in numbers in itself is remarkable. In 1741 it
possessed but three marching companies, but from that
year onwards it was constantly increased by one, two,
or four companies, until in 1757 it consisted of twenty-four
companies in two battalions and in 1761 of thirty-one
companies in three battalions, or close on thirty-two
hundred of all ranks. Finally, in 1760, a warrant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>was issued for the formation of a distinct regiment of
Royal Irish Artillery.</p>

<p>At first the gunners are seen at work principally
with the battalion guns, light three-pounders or six-pounders,
which though attached to the infantry were
served by artillerymen;<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> but they are always distinguished,
whether at Fontenoy or before Trichinopoly,
by the rapidity and accuracy of their fire. In Germany,
however, we find the guns before Minden scientifically
concentrated and handled in large masses by the skill of
the Count of Lippe-Bückeburg; and there the British
batteries win the admiration of the most critical
artillerists in Europe, and their officers the special
praise of Ferdinand of Brunswick himself. The
influence of the Academy had told early; but it is a
still more significant fact that British Artillery officers,
not obtaining their commissions by purchase, did not
rise to command without knowledge of their work.
The variety of guns issued for the field was very great,
and though three-pounders seem to have given place in
the Seven Years' War to light six-pounders as the lightest
ordnance employed,<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> yet there were also heavy six-pounders,
light and heavy twelve-pounders, howitzers
and twenty-four pounders. It was probably the light
six-pounders that amazed the whole army at Warburg
by advancing at the gallop, a feat which was the more
remarkable since drivers and horses were still hired, and
not part and parcel of the corps as at present.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Finally,
Mauvillon bears witness that the British guns were kept
far the cleanest and in the most perfect order of any in
the whole Allied army.</p>

<p>Of the Engineers it is impossible to speak as favourably;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>indeed it is almost an extreme assumption to assert
their existence except in name. A school of engineering
was founded in 1741; and the small establishment
of engineers as fixed in 1717 having been largely
increased in 1756 was finally reorganised with a strength
of sixty-one officers in 1759.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> There seem to have
been no men, except a strong company of miners, which,
however, was borne on the strength of the Royal
Artillery.<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> The results of the school were singularly
small compared with those of the Academy at Woolwich.
Wentworth possessed one efficient engineer at Carthagena,
but Stair had not even one in the Low Countries,
and was obliged to engage Dutch and Austrian officers;<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
while the engineers employed with Boscawen at Pondicherry,
Abercromby at Ticonderoga, and Hodgson at
Belleisle were all alike inefficient. The fact is less
remarkable when it is remembered that the sea obviates
the necessity for the fortification of inland towns in
England. In truth the French engineers, in respect
both of the skill of the officers and the organisation
of the men, seem to have stood far above the rest of
Europe,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> while the British probably stood lowest of all.</p>

<p>Lastly we come to the Infantry. Attention has
already been called to the reforms initiated by Howe,
Washington, Forbes, Bouquet, and Amherst, which,
though still too much advanced to receive welcome at
home, were to be realised by Sir John Moore forty
years later. The great characteristic of the British
infantry throughout the war is the excellence of their
fire-discipline and the deadly accuracy of their fire.
It is curious, therefore, to read in the most popular
military handbook of the time<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> that it was precisely in
the matter of fire-discipline that the British were
reckoned defective, so defective that they were accounted
inferior to the Dutch and were obliged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>comfort themselves with the reflection that the Dutch
were naturally more phlegmatic of temperament. The
author is careful to point out that Dutch superiority lay
in discipline only, so it is reasonable to infer that the
British improved rapidly in this respect during the war.
And such indeed is the conclusion to be drawn from
the study of the various actions. At Dettingen the
fire though deadly was unsteady; at Fontenoy it was
nearly perfect; at Minden, where the British stood
motionless until the French cavalry was within ten
paces, it was quite admirable; at Quebec it was simply
superlative. It is commonly supposed that this improvement
was due to the adoption of Prussian methods,
but I can find no ground for the assumption. The
Prussian manual and firing exercise did indeed find
its way to the First Guards in 1756;<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and there
still exists record of a petition from some aged
pensioners against the cruelty of an ensign who drilled
them every day through the winter in the Prussian
exercise, though they had hardly clothes to cover their
nakedness;<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> but this has no bearing on the action of
Fontenoy in 1745. The truth is that in the matter
of attack the British had nothing to learn from the
Prussians, either in the cavalry or the infantry. Marlborough
had taught them the superiority of shock-action
and platoon-fire long before Frederick the Great
was born; and all that the Prussian school had to teach,
apart from this and from the discipline which went to
its perfect execution, was the precision of march learned
from pendulum and pace-stick, and certain undeniable
improvements in the manœuvre of a regiment or
battalion. It has been suggested, indeed,<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> that a Prussian
column at Fontenoy might have manœuvred its way to
victory by sheer perfection of drill and discipline; but
this begs the question whether they would have
preserved their order as admirably as the British during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>the advance. Certainly it is hardly conceivable that
even Prussian regiments could have behaved more
perfectly under very heavy fire and in the presence of
an overwhelming force of cavalry than the six British
battalions at Minden.</p>

<p>But the most important changes in the infantry
were akin to those in the cavalry. The first was the
practice of massing the grenadiers of the army into
battalions, which though forbidden by the King as an
Austrian innovation when first proposed by Stair,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> was
ultimately adopted both in America and in Germany.
The next was the introduction of light troops for the
work of skirmishing and for such rapid movements
and special duties as were committed in the cavalry to
hussars. In the British Army the first representatives
of this class of infantry were the Highlanders, who for
this reason were armed with short muskets or carbines
and were drawn up outside the line in the formal order
of battle. Stair<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> had begged for Highlanders in their
native dress as early as in 1742, and to his influence
probably was due their presence at Fontenoy. During
the Seven Years' War, as has been seen, they were
employed in every quarter of the globe and did excellent
service. Amherst, however, and Wolfe after
him, were not content with Highlanders only, but
formed those bodies of marksmen, often armed with
rifles, which prepared the way for the Light Companies
and the complete corps of Light Infantry and Riflemen
that were to follow at a later day. Indeed, there was
actually a regiment (which during its short life took precedence
as ninetieth of the Line) that was called Morgan's
Light Infantry. This was probably an imitation from
some continental model; but the British had found a
far better model for their own purposes in America.</p>

<p>In truth, though there were lessons which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>British might learn with profit from foreign nations,
both as to what they should imitate and what they
should avoid, the best of their instruction was that
which they gained from their own hard experience in
lands remote from Europe. The influence of King
Frederick the Great was perverted in great measure for
ill to the Army. The King and Cumberland had both
of them a passion for minute details of dress, facings,
lace, buttons, cockades, and the like, and were dear
lovers of the tight clothing and inelasticity of movement
which characterised the Prussian school. There can be
no doubt, on the other hand, that strict insistence on
cleanliness and smartness is indispensable, and that
correctness and uniformity of dress are valuable aids
to discipline and to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>. Such little distinctions
as that the coats of Horse should be lapelled
to the skirt and of Dragoons to the waist, while those
of Light Dragoons should be without lapels of any
kind, are harmless in themselves, and give men a pride
and an interest in their branch of the service; but the
powdering of hair, the docking of the old-fashioned
serviceable coats, and the straitening of every article of
raiment were no gain to efficiency, no improvement to
health, and in the eyes of Englishmen, at first, no
embellishment as to appearance.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Had the King turned
his thoughts to diminishing the weight on a soldier's back,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>or devising suitable equipment for tropical climates,
he might have saved lives untold; but many years
were still to elapse before such simple matters as these
were to receive due notice. The beautiful accuracy
of drill enjoined by Frederick was turned to good
account by the British on many fields in Europe and
in India; but his excellent discipline on active service
both on and off duty was by no means so faithfully
copied, as Ferdinand of Brunswick found out to his
cost.<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Yet at any rate the British had an example of the
worst that they must eschew in the armies of the French.
Therein "there was no discipline, no subordination, no
order on the march, in the camp or even in the battlefield.
The very subalterns had their mistresses with
them, and officers often left their men to accompany
them on the march in their carriages. Everything
that could contribute to the luxury of the officers was
found in the French camp.... At one time there
were twelve thousand waggons accompanying Soubise's
army which belonged to sutlers and shopkeepers, though
the army was not fifty thousand strong.... Balls
were given in camp and officers often left their posts
to dance a minuet. They laughed at the orders of
their leaders and only obeyed when it suited them."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>
From such folly and disgrace as this Cumberland's
attachment to the stricter models of Germany delivered
the Army; but its best lessons came not from Germany
but from America, not from Frederick the Great
but from Howe, Washington, Wolfe, Bouquet, and
Amherst.</p>

every man from one regiment to another entailed also a transfer of

and lie in a confused bundle in the Record Office. The most
remarkable among them are those of Grant of Glenmoriston to his
wife, bidding her double the rents of all deserters who had returned
home, and to oust them from their holdings. There is also a love-letter
from a sergeant, whom I take to have been a deserter from the
English garrison at Fort Augustus, which I print as a curiosity:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Muslebrogh, Oct. 30 1745. Dr Love I received your letter
which I was vary glad to hear that you was in good health. I sa[w]
Janet my ant and I did not get the letter you sent with Allan Royson.
Alexander McLean your ant['s] son was asking the letter to read it
but I wold not give hime it for fear that if (<em>sic</em>) he wold go soonner
home and that he wold be casting it up to you as to a foole. It is
a thing that is impossible to me to get because we are in oppinion
every day to marge [march] on to England and [I] being a serjant
and having the truble of the company&mdash;And God know how soon I
can present my love to you, and nevertheless my love is as constant
to you as it was formerly, and being in a bade [bad] condition every
night and day, minding [remembering] you and your kindness and
pleasant company. And I am in very good health since I wrott the
last letter and nothing els [ails] me but the wanting of you, and I
hope in God we shall make all things complete if I shall ever
return. I am your most obedient love Duncan McGillise. Give
my service to your children." <em>Addressed</em>, "Margrat McDonell in
the cantain within the baraks of Fortugustus [Fort Augustus]."
</p>
<p>
I have preserved the spelling of the sergeant, but have perforce
added punctuation, which is absolutely wanting in the original.</p></div>

erected this city (as undoubtedly was the case) as much for the
impression that it would create in the native mind as for gratification
of his personal vanity, Clive would have been wrong if he had not
razed it. If it was French policy to build such a city, it was undoubtedly
English policy to pull it down, and generosity has no place
in the question. It is absurd to treat Dupleix Futtehabad as though

well known, but the following, I think, is new. An officer had
been foisted upon Braddock on his appointment to the command,
whom (in order to be rid of him) he placed in command of a small
provincial fort at Cape Fear. Governor Dobbs of Carolina having
complained of this officer, Braddock replied "that the man had
been imposed upon him, that he would not trust him with the
building of a hog-sty, and that the best thing Dobbs could do
would be to hang him on the first tree he could find." The story
is told in a letter of Governor Dobbs to General Amherst of 28th
August 1762. <cite>Record Office, W. O., Original Correspondence</cite>, vol. xiii.</p></div>

from a distinguished officer on so purely technical a matter as the
manœuvres preceding a general action, but it seems to me that
Colonel Malleson has missed this point. Coote, so far as I
can gather, not only forced Lally to fight but also to forego at least
part of the advantages which he had prepared for himself. One
would infer from Malleson's narrative that Lally adhered to the
position which he had chosen from the first. "His left, thrown
forward, resting on a tank and, supported by an entrenchment on
the other side of it, formed an obtuse angle with his line and commanded
the ground over which the enemy must pass." Orme's
account, which is the fullest, is extremely confused; but he says
distinctly that Lally was obliged to wheel round his right, which
would necessarily imply that the left could no longer be thrown
forward, and that the battery at the entrenched tank could no
longer rake the whole of his front. And this I take to have been
a principal object of Coote's manœuvre. Again, the smaller tank,
which in Lally's first position is spoken of as being in his left front,
is described in the action as being in his rear (<cite>Orme</cite>), implying that
Lally must have changed position half if not three-quarters left.
Finally, Lawrence's <cite>Memoirs</cite>, though meagre on this point, speak
distinctly of a first and second disposition of the French.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
